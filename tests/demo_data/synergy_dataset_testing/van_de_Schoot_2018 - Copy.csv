doi1,Annual Research Review: Resilience and mental health in children and adolescents living in areas of armed conflict - a systematic review of findings in low- and middle-income countries,"Researchers focused on mental health of conflict-affected children are increasingly interested in the concept of resilience. Knowledge on resilience may assist in developing interventions aimed at improving positive outcomes or reducing negative outcomes, termed promotive or protective interventions.We performed a systematic review of peer-reviewed qualitative and quantitative studies focused on resilience and mental health in children and adolescents affected by armed conflict in low- and middle-income countries.Altogether 53 studies were identified: 15 qualitative and mixed methods studies and 38 quantitative, mostly cross-sectional studies focused on school-aged children and adolescents. Qualitative studies identified variation across socio-cultural settings of relevant resilience outcomes, and report contextually unique processes contributing to such outcomes. Quantitative studies focused on promotive and protective factors at different socio-ecological levels (individual, family-, peer-, school-, and community-levels). Generally, promotive and protective factors showed gender-, symptom-, and phase of conflict-specific effects on mental health outcomes.Although limited by its predominantly cross-sectional nature and focus on protective outcomes, this body of knowledge supports a perspective of resilience as a complex dynamic process driven by time- and context-dependent variables, rather than the balance between risk- and protective factors with known impacts on mental health. Given the complexity of findings in this population, we conclude that resilience-focused interventions will need to be highly tailored to specific contexts, rather than the application of a universal model that may be expected to have similar effects on mental health across contexts.",1
doi2,Profiling the Trauma Related Symptoms of Bosnian Refugees Who Have not Sought Mental Health Services,"The objective of this study was to profile trauma related psychiatric symptoms in a group of refugees not seeking mental health services and to consider the services implications. The study involved research assessments of two groups of Bosnian refugees: those who have not presented for mental health services and those who have. A total of 28 of 41 nonpresenters (70%) met symptom criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis. All service presenters (N = 29) met symptom criteria for PTSD diagnosis. The group that did not present for services reported substantial but lower trauma exposure, PTSD symptom severity, and depression symptom severity. They had significant differences on all subscales of the MOS SF-36, indicating better health status. We concluded that those who do not seek services have substantial symptom levels, but their self-concept appears to be less oriented toward illness and help seeking. Innovative access, engagement, and preventive interventions are needed to address those who have symptoms but do not readily seek help for trauma mental health services.",1
doi3,"Acute panicogenic, anxiogenic and dissociative effects of carbon dioxide inhalation in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)","Increased anxiety and panic to inhalation of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) has been described in patients with anxiety disorders, especially panic disorder, compared to healthy subjects. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been hypothesised to resemble panic disorder and is currently classified as an anxiety disorder in DSM-IV. However, there are only very few data available about the sensitivity of patients with PTSD to CO(2).In 10 patients with PTSD, 10 sex- and age-matched healthy subjects and 8 patients with panic disorder we assessed anxiety, panic, dissociative and PTSD symptoms before and after a single vital capacity inhalation of 35% CO(2).Patients with PTSD showed an increased anxiety, panic and dissociative reaction to the inhalation of 35% CO(2) compared to healthy participants. PTSD subjects' responses were indistinguishable from those of panic patients. Additionally, PTSD-typical symptoms like post-traumatic flashbacks were provoked in patients with PTSD after the inhalation of CO(2).In our sample, PTSD was associated with an increased CO(2) reactivity, pointing to an increased susceptibility of PTSD patients to CO(2) challenge.",1
doi4,A Pooled Analysis of Gender and Trauma-Type Effects on Responsiveness to Treatment of PTSD With Venlafaxine Extended Release or Placebo,"To examine effects of gender and trauma type on response to treatment with venlafaxine extended release (ER) or placebo in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Data were pooled from 2 flexible-dose, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials: a 12-week trial conducted in the United States (March 2001 to December 2002) and a 24-week trial conducted in 12 countries outside the United States (October 2001 to December 2003). Six hundred eighty-seven outpatients with DSM-IV-diagnosed PTSD and a 17-item Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale abbreviated 1-week Symptom Status version (CAPS-SX-17) score > or = 60 were randomly assigned to treatment with venlafaxine ER (37.5 mg/day-300 mg/day, N = 340) or placebo (N = 347). The primary efficacy end point was the CAPS-SX-17 total score at week 12. Secondary end points included CAPS-SX-17 cluster scores for reexperiencing, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal and scores on the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale, Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17). Analysis-of-covariance models were used to test for differences by gender and trauma type (accidental injury, combat, nonsexual abuse, adult sexual abuse, childhood sexual abuse, unexpected death, and other), treatment (venlafaxine ER vs. placebo), and the treatment-by-trauma-type interaction.Using last-observation-carried-forward analysis, significant effects of treatment with venlafaxine ER were found on the CAPS-SX-17 total score and on all CAPS-SX-17 cluster scores and most other secondary measures. No significant treatment-by-gender interactions were observed. Trauma type significantly affected treatment responsiveness on symptom-related disability (SDS, p = .0057) and resilience (CD-RISC, p = .0012), with a nearly significant effect on depression (HAM-D-17, p = .0625).Overall, there does not appear to be a significant effect of gender on the efficacy of venlafaxine ER in the treatment of PTSD. Trauma type may affect treatment outcome but seems to affect domains such as disability and resilience more than core PTSD symptoms.",1
doi5,Twelve-Month Use of Mental Health Services in the United States,"Dramatic changes have occurred in mental health treatments during the past decade. Data on recent treatment patterns are needed to estimate the unmet need for services.To provide data on patterns and predictors of 12-month mental health treatment in the United States from the recently completed National Comorbidity Survey Replication.Nationally representative face-to-face household survey using a fully structured diagnostic interview, the World Health Organization's World Mental Health Survey Initiative version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, carried out between February 5, 2001, and April 7, 2003.A total of 9282 English-speaking respondents 18 years and older.Proportions of respondents with 12-month DSM-IV anxiety, mood, impulse control, and substance disorders who received treatment in the 12 months before the interview in any of 4 service sectors (specialty mental health, general medical, human services, and complementary and alternative medicine). Number of visits and proportion of patients who received minimally adequate treatment were also assessed.Of 12-month cases, 41.1% received some treatment in the past 12 months, including 12.3% treated by a psychiatrist, 16.0% treated by a non-psychiatrist mental health specialist, 22.8% treated by a general medical provider, 8.1% treated by a human services provider, and 6.8% treated by a complementary and alternative medical provider (treatment could be received by >1 source). Overall, cases treated in the mental health specialty sector received more visits (median, 7.4) than those treated in the general medical sector (median, 1.7). More patients in specialty than general medical treatment also received treatment that exceeded a minimal threshold of adequacy (48.3% vs 12.7%). Unmet need for treatment is greatest in traditionally underserved groups, including elderly persons, racial-ethnic minorities, those with low incomes, those without insurance, and residents of rural areas.Most people with mental disorders in the United States remain either untreated or poorly treated. Interventions are needed to enhance treatment initiation and quality.",1
doi6,Rats exposed to traumatic stress bury unfamiliar objects â€” A novel measure of hyper-vigilance in PTSD models?,"Electric shocks lead to lasting behavioral deficits in rodents, and as such are often used to model post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the laboratory. Here we show that a single exposure of rats to 3 mA-strong shocks results in a marked social avoidance that lasts at least 28 days; moreover, the response intensifies over time. In an attempt to study the impact of cue reminders on the behavior of shocked rats, we administered shocks in the presence of a highly conspicuous, 10 cm-large object. This object was introduced into the home cage of rats 28 days after shock exposure. Shocked rats manipulated the object considerably less than controls. More importantly, however, the object was buried by shocked rats. This behavior was virtually absent in controls. The response strongly depended on the intensity of shocks, and was robust. Rats shocked with 3 mA currents spent 40% of time burying the object, which was often hardly visible at the end of the 5 min test. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that the response was not cue-specific as unfamiliar objects were also buried. Rats are well known to bury dangerous objects; the shock-prod burying test of anxiety is based on this response. Behavioral similarities with this test and the differences from the marble-burying behavior of mice suggest that traumatized rats bury unfamiliar objects in defense, and the response can be interpreted as a sign of hyper-vigilance. We further suggest that object burying can be used as a sign of hyper-vigilance in models of PTSD.",1
doi7,Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation for Comorbid Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder,"External stimulation of the trigeminal nerve (eTNS) is an emerging neuromodulation therapy for epilepsy and depression. Preliminary studies suggest it has an excellent safety profile and is associated with significant improvements in seizures and mood. Neuroanatomical projections of the trigeminal system suggest eTNS may alter activity in structures regulating mood, anxiety, and sleep. In this proof-of-concept trial, the effects of eTNS were evaluated in adults with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy for these commonly co-occurring conditions.Twelve adults with PTSD and MDD were studied in an eight-week open outpatient trial (age 52.8 [13.7 sd], 8F:4M). Stimulation was applied to the supraorbital and supratrochlear nerves for eight hours each night as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy. Changes in symptoms were monitored using the PTSD Patient Checklist (PCL), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17), Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-C), and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q).Over the eight weeks, eTNS treatment was associated with significant decreases in PCL (p = 0.003; median decrease of 15 points; effect size d 1.5), HDRS-17 (p < 0.001; 42% response rate, 25% remission; d 2.1), and QIDS-C scores (p < 0.001; d 1.8), as well as an improvement in quality of life (Q-LES-Q, p < 0.01). eTNS was well tolerated with few treatment emergent adverse events.Significant improvements in PTSD and depression severity were achieved in the eight weeks of acute eTNS treatment. This novel approach to wearable brain stimulation may have use as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy in these disorders if efficacy and tolerability are confirmed with additional studies.",1
doi8,Military Resilience: A Concept Analysis,"Since the events surrounding September 11, 2011, and natural disasters, research on resilience has shifted from children to adult resilience. The military began to embrace the concept in 2008 in an effort to decrease the number of military service member (SM) suicides.The purpose of this article is to explain resilience as it relates to military SMs using the process for concept analysis outlined by Walker and Avant (2005).Adaptive coping, personal control, hardiness, and social support are the attributes that characterize psychological resilience in SMs. Antecedents for resilience are life events such as serious accidents, prior deployments where death is witnessed, and combat involvement. Consequences of high resilience include decreased mental health symptoms and career and personal success, while consequences of low resilience include increased mental health symptoms and participating in high-risk behaviors.Understanding resilience as it relates to SMs is critical. Nurses must be able to assess SMs and be equipped to refer them or their family members to the most appropriate care. As more is learned about resilience in the military community, there may be broader implications to the civilian community. Improved understanding of psychological resilience may lead to improved interventions appropriate for both civilians and military SMs.",1
doi9,Looking like the enemy: An interpretative phenomenological analysis of how race-related stressors in the military contribute to post traumatic stress disorder in Asian American and Pacific Islander Vietnam veterans,"Although significant evidence exists in the current literature about both the impact of race-related stressors on racial minority groups as well as the psychological impact of military-related stressors, there is very little research demonstrating the complexities of what a soldier may experience when a war is fought in a country where she/he resembles the enemy. This study explores how race-related stressors experienced in the military by Vietnam War veterans of Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) ancestry contributed to the severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other trauma-related psychiatric disorders. This topic has been explored by researchers out of the VA Pacific Islands Health Care System, National Center for PTSD in 1994 and their findings suggest that race-related stressors is a significant predictor of PTSD symptoms for Vietnam veterans of AAPI ancestry. Almost two decades since that study was conducted, this dissertation will examine, through the use of focus groups, if certain phenomenological themes have remained constant over time and also if new ones emerge. The generated hypothesis is that there will be phenomenological themes that abide over time related to the extended biopsychosocial effects of race-related stressors, particularly in the context of war. The second hypothesis posits that new themes will also surface as a result of the different political, social, and cultural climate these veterans currently reside in nearly two decades later. Clinical implications and suggestions for future research are also explored. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)",1
