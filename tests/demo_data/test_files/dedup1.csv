M8465,10.1080/00207140903310790,"Hypnotizability, posttraumatic stress, and depressive symptoms in metastatic breast cancer","This study assessed whether high hypnotizability is associated with posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms in a sample of 124 metastatic breast cancer patients. Hypnotic Induction Profile Scores were dichotomized into low and high categories; posttraumatic intrusion and avoidance symptoms were measured with the Impact of Events Scale (IES); hyperarousal symptoms with items from the Profile of Mood States; and depressive symptoms with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale. High hypnotizability was significantly related to greater IES total, IES intrusion symptoms, and depressive symptoms. A logistic regression model showed that IES total predicts high hypnotizability after adjusting for depressive symptoms and hyperarousal. The authors relate these results to findings in other clinical populations and discuss implications for the psychosocial treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
