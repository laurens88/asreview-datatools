Hypnotic Induction Profile Scores were dichotomized into low and high categories; posttraumatic intrusion and avoidance symptoms were measured with the Impact of Events Scale (IES); hyperarousal symptoms with items from the Profile of Mood States; and depressive symptoms with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale. High hypnotizability was significantly related to greater IES total, IES intrusion symptoms, and depressive symptoms. A logistic regression model showed that IES total predicts high hypnotizability after adjusting for depressive symptoms and hyperarousal. The authors relate these results to findings in other clinical populations and discuss implications for the psychosocial treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

1,M6468,10.1213/01.ANE.0000398215.59935.49,25 years experience with ketamine in a cancer ICU,"Introduction : Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist that has been a well-known anesthetic agent for many years. In small doses it also has analgesic effects while having minimal effects on respiration and hemodynamics, making it a useful adjunct in the treatment of patients in ICU settings. For the last 25 years at the Norris Cancer Hospital ICU, we have used ketamine in the vast majority of our cases, consisting mainly of urologic patients as well as general surgery and gynecology-oncology patients. We attribute to ketamine our improved outcome relating to pain relief, early extubation, and stable hemodynamics, which results in decreased morbidity. Methods : We retrospectively studied data from the Urology department data bank and the hospital pharmacy for the use of ketamine. 85% of the patients had undergone extensive urologic resections including radical cystectomy, pelvic exenteration, radical nephrectomies, and radical retroperitoneal lymph node dissections; other procedures included Whipple, hepatectomy, abdominoperineal resection, and major gynecological cancer procedures. A combination infusion of ketamine (500 mg) and fentanyl (1250 mcg) in 250cc normal saline was used in patients that were extubated. Initially, patients received 2-4 mg of intravenous morphine before the mixture began to take effect. In cases of ventilated patients midazolam (25 mg) was added to the combination. Clinical parameters of pain and sedation were evaluated by the ICU resident and nurses and the infusions were titrated accordingly. Results : Most surgical patients were extubated on an average of 1-2 days postoperatively. The average dose requirement was 3-7cc/ hr, ranging from 2cc/hr to 10cc/hr, titrated to pain relief. No changes in hemodynamics were noted with the dose range and combination; there was no incidence of hypotension or tachycardia. Respirations were unaffected. Analgesia was observed to be superior to each of the drugs on its own, indicating a synergistic rather than additive effect. Less than 1% of patients complained of visual dreams, slightly lower than those receiving only morphine. There were no cases of prolonged ileus attributable to the combination. There was a very low incidence of depression, both immediate and delayed, and the incidence of PTSD and anxiety states were negligible. Discussion : Ketamine has many beneficial effects in addition to analgesia and amnesia. It is a bronchodilator and has minimal effects on respiration, making it easier to wean patients off respirators. Its cholinergic agonist properties have a positive effect on postoperative ileus. Ketamine also has been shown to be effective for preemptive analgesia and in minimizing opioid-induced hyperalgesia. It has anti-kinin and anti-inflammatory properties, as it decreases TNF levels. It affords CNS protection by increasing cerebral blood flow and via its NMDA receptor blockade, which protects patients from glutamate-induced brain injury. Ketamine in low doses also appears to have minimal effect on cognitive function.",2010.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,M6567,10.1016/j.brat.2010.05.021,Facial asymmetry detection in patients with body dysmorphic disorder,"Cognitive-behavioral models of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) propose that individuals with BDD may possess a better or more developed sense of aestheticality than do individuals without BDD. Evidence for this proposition, however, is limited. One perceptual process that could contribute to heightened aestheticality is the ability to detect differences in symmetry. In this experiment we tested whether individuals with BDD (n= 20), relative to individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD; n= 20) and healthy controls (n= 20), show an enhanced ability to detect differences in the symmetry of others' faces, symmetry of dot arrays, and/or show a greater preference for symmetrical faces. Individuals with BDD were not significantly more accurate in detecting differences in facial symmetry or dot arrays relative to individuals with OCD and healthy controls. Individuals with OCD took longer to make facial symmetry judgments than did individuals in the other two groups. All participants, regardless of diagnostic group, preferred more symmetrical faces than nonsymmetrical ones. Taken together, our results do not support a heightened perceptual ability or evaluative preference for symmetry among individuals with BDD. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2010.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study offers a populationbased assessment of the prevalence of sexual violence and human rights abuses in specific territories within Eastern DRC. Objective: To assess the prevalence of and correlations with sexual violence and human rights violations on residents of specific territories of Eastern DRC including information on basic needs, health care access, and physical and mental health. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional, population-based, cluster survey of 998 adults aged 18 years or older using structured interviews and questionnaires, conducted over a 4-week period in March 2010. Main Outcome Measures: Sexual violence prevalence and characteristics, symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), human rights abuses, and physical and mental health needs among Congolese adults in specific territories of Eastern DRC. Results: Of the 1005 households surveyed 998 households participated, yielding a response rate of 98.9%. Rates of reported sexual violence were 39.7% (95% confidence interval CI], 32.2%-47.2%; n=224/586) among women and 23.6% (95% CI, 17.3%-29.9%; n=107/399) among men.

4,M11364,,Sleep profile in post-traumatic disorder patients: A polysomnographic evaluation in an Egyptian sample,"Introduction and Objectives: Although sleep disturbance is considered a hallmark of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), objective evidence for sleep disturbance in those patients has been equivocal. The aim of this study is to explore the subjective and objective sleep disturbance in PTSD patients, and its correlation with severity of PTSD symptoms. Materials and Methods: The study included 20 patients fulfilling DSM-IV-TR criteria of PTSD, recruited from outpatient clinics of the Institute of Psychiatry, Ain Shams University, Cairo (aged 18-45 years, no medical or mental comorbidity and medication free, for at least two weeks). A control group of 10 healthy volunteers (age and sex matched) were slected from emploees of the same Institute of Psychiatry. All patients were subjected to complete medical and neurological examination, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV axis-I diagnosis (SCID-I), PTSD Checklist (PCL), Standardized Sleep Questionnaire (SSQ) (in Arabic), and overnight polysomnographic (PSG) assessment. Control group completed General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)and general physical examination to exclude any medical or mental morbidity as well as SSQ and PSG. Results: Subjective sleep assessment revealed more initial and middle insomnias in the patients group with higher prevalence of nightmares and sleep talking. Significant differences in PSG revealed longer sleep latency, lower sleep efficiency and higher arousal index in PTSD patients. Increased stages I and II, with decreased SWS, were obtained in patients, with no significant difference regarding REM sleep parameters, and sleep related breathing disturbance. Periodic limb movement index was significantly higher in PTSD patients. Correlation between sleep changes and severity of PTSD was not significant. Conclusion: Our study confirmed both subjective and objective sleep abnormality in patients with PTSD. Despite the higher prevalence of nightmares, the nature of PSG abnormality is more related to NREM parameters, with no significant correlation between sleep changes and severity of PTSD symptoms.",2011.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,M6187,10.1016/j.whi.2011.04.013,Work-Related Quality of Life and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms Among Female Veterans,"Background Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can have pervasive, negative effects on multiple aspects of quality of life. We investigated the relationship between PTSD symptom clusters and work-related quality of life among female veterans. Although prior studies have shown that PTSD symptom clusters are differentially related to work-related quality of life, no study has assessed these relationships in women specifically. Methods Participants were 253 female veterans with current PTSD. We assessed three components of work-related quality of life (employment status, clinician-rated occupational impairment, and self-rated occupational satisfaction) and performed analyses with and without adjusting for self-reported depression symptoms. Results None of the PTSD symptom clusters were associated with employment status. All PTSD symptom clusters had significant independent associations with occupational impairment. All PTSD symptom clusters except avoidance were significantly associated with lower occupational satisfaction, but none had independent associations with occupational satisfaction. No single PTSD symptom cluster emerged as most strongly associated with occupational outcomes. Symptoms of depression had substantial associations across all occupational outcomes, independent of PTSD symptoms. Conclusion Knowledge about how PTSD relates to occupational outcomes in women veterans is important for addressing the needs of this growing segment of the VA patient population, in which PTSD is a prevalent condition. Because PTSD had differential relationships with the three components of work-related quality of life, measuring only one component, or using an aggregate measure, may obscure important distinctions. Resolving depression symptoms also may be integral to achieving meaningful recovery.",2011.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,M4841,10.1227/NEU.0b013e31820cd40d,Health-related quality of life after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: Profile and clinical factors,"Background: Health-related quality of life has recently been suggested as a supplement to the traditional neurological outcome measures from the patient's perspective according to the World Health Organization model and may capture the effects of other factors such as posttraumatic stress disorder and neuroendocrine dysfunction. Objective: To explore the profile and clinical factors of quality of life after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage using the data we obtained from the recently completed Intravenous Magnesium Sulphate After Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (IMASH) trial. Methods: This study was registered at www.strokecenter.org/trials and www.ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00124150). Data from a patient cohort obtained with the Short Form-36 questionnaire completed at 6 months were used for analysis. Results: Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage demonstrated a decrease in quality of life according to the Short Form-36 at 6 months. The physical and mental health scores correlated with the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale and had the potential to avoid the ceiling effect. Multiple regression analyses showed that the physical component scores were related to age, World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grade, and chronic hydrocephalus and that the mental component scores were not related to the traditional prognostic factors. Conclusion: Subarachnoid hemorrhage caused a decrease in quality of life. Chronic hydrocephalus is related to a decrease in physical health quality of life.

7,M8847,10.1001/jama.2011.1052,"Prevalence of war-related mental health conditions and association with displacement status in postwar Jaffna District, Sri Lanka","Context: Nearly 2.7 million individuals worldwide are internally displaced (seeking refuge in secure areas of their own country) annually by armed conflict. Although the psychological impact of war has been well documented, less is known about the mental health symptoms of forced displacement among internally displaced persons. Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of the most common war-related mental health conditions, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression, and to assess the association between displacement status and these conditions in postwar Jaffna District, Sri Lanka. Design, Setting, and Participants: Between July and September 2009, a cross-sectional multistage cluster sample survey was conducted among 1517 Jaffna District households including 2 internally displaced persons camps. The response rate was 92% (1448 respondents, 1409 eligible respondents). Two percent of participants (n=80) were currently displaced, 29.5% (n=539) were recently resettled, and 68.5% (n=790) were long-term residents. Bivariable analyses followed by multivariable logistic regression models were performed to determine the association between displacement status and mental health. Main Outcome Measures: Symptom criteria of PTSD, anxiety, and depression as measured by the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25. Results: The overall prevalences of symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression were 7.0% (95% confidence interval CI], 5.1%-9.7%), 32.6% (95% CI, 28.5%-36.9%), and 22.2% (95% CI, 18.2%-26.5%), respectively. Currently displaced participants were more likely to report symptoms of PTSD (odds ratio OR], 2.71; 95% CI, 1.28-5.73), anxiety (OR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.89-4.48), and depression (OR, 4.55; 95% CI, 2.47-8.39) compared with long-term residents. Recently resettled residents were more likely to report symptoms of PTSD (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.11-3.47) compared with long-term residents. However, displacement was no longer associated with mental health symptoms after controlling for trauma exposure. Conclusion: Among residents of Jaffna District in Sri Lanka, prevalence of symptoms of war-related mental health conditions was substantial and significantly associated with displacement status and underlying trauma exposure. ©2011 American Medical Association.

8,M5293,10.1016/j.physio.2011.04.002,Poor functional recovery after discharge from the intensive care unit; a challenge to improve outcome after critical illness,"Purpose: To develop adequate rehabilitation follow-up care for survivors of the intensive care unit (ICU), we investigated impairments in body functions, limitations in activities, and restrictions in participation after critical illness. Relevance: With increasing survival rates of ICU patients, the proportion of patients with subsequent problems in daily functioning has been growing. It has been recognized that the intensive support of these patients needs to be continued after discharge from the ICU. However, structured rehabilitation follow-up care is currently rare and the optimal structure, timing, and content have not been established. Participants: Consecutive series of patients who were ventilated for more than 48 hours in a mixed, closed-format, university-level ICU. Methods: Functional health status was assessed in two observational studies. In 255 patients daily functioning was assessed 12 months after discharge from the ICU using the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP68). In a follow-up study in 20 patients, impairments in body functions, limitations in activities, and restrictions in participation were evaluated using the ICF checklist 3 and 12 months after discharge. Symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder were evaluated with the Impact on Event Scale (IES). Analysis: Patient characteristics and outcome measures were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Results: During the first year after discharge from the ICU, the performance of daily activities improved, but the prevalence of limitations in activities remained high. After one year, 54% of the patients were limited in the performance of daily activities; 22% had mild, and 32% had severe limitations. Walking stairs, hills, and distances and social activities related to community life and recreation were most frequently limited (30-60% of the patients). Moreover, the prevalence of impairments (joint mobility 46%, muscle strength 50%, attention 73%, memory 41%, physical endurance 83%, post traumatic stress 19%), and restrictions in participation (employment 46%, recreation 50%) was high. Conclusions: The high prevalence and the severity of long lasting ICU related impairments in physical and mental functions, and the restrictions in activities, necessitates the development of appropriate rehabilitation interventions for patients who stayed in the ICU for at least 2 days. Multidisciplinary after-care should aim at the improvement of physical recovery and the reduction of symptoms of anxiety, depression and post traumatic stress disorder. Implications: Physical therapy treatment need to be developed and evaluated as part of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme to help ICU patients to improve functional independence and return to work or to activities of daily living.",2011.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,M8441,10.1016/j.neurenf.2012.05.369,Children exposed to school accident: Community based 3-year follow-up study,"Objectives.-We explored the course of trauma-related psychological symptoms and psychiatric diagnoses in 167 children after witnessing death at school and assessed the long-term effects of their symptoms on quality of life and their parents' rearing stress. Methods.- We note that 167 children were evaluated using diverse self-rating symptom scales at 2 days (T1), 2 months (T2), 6 months (T3), and 30 months (T4) after the accident. All children were interviewed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-IV (DISC-IV) at T1. High-risk children were assessed with the DISC-IV at T3 and T4. Children's quality of life and parental stress were assessed using the Parent Stress Index and the Children's Health and Illness Profile at T4. Results.- The mean score and prevalence of severe PTSD and anxiety symptoms decreased significantly over time, but depressive symptoms did not. Though the prevalence of diverse anxiety disorders decreased significantly over time, forty five percent of highly risk subjects evaluated with the DISC-IV, met criteria for an anxiety or depressive disorder at T4. Linear and logistic regression analyses showed that depressive symptoms at 6 months predicted more severe parental stress (b = 0.51; odds ratio OR], 2.88), less satisfaction (b = -0.30; OR, 2.66), and lower achievement (b = -0.41; OR, 1.5) at 30 months. PTSD or anxiety symptoms were not associated with parental stress or quality of life at T4. Conclusions.- This study provides new evidence regarding the long-term course of trauma-related symptoms and diagnostic changes in children exposed to a single trauma. Children's depressive symptoms predicted the lower children's quality of life and higher parental rearing stress after 2 years. Careful assessment and management of depressive symptoms potentially reduce parental stress and improve quality of life of children.",2012.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,M7270,10.1037/a0028518,The correspondence of daily and retrospective PTSD reports among female victims of sexual assault,"Research addressing the association between daily and retrospective symptom reports suggests that retrospective reports are typically inflated. The present study examined the association between daily posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom reports over 1 month and a corresponding retrospective report (PTSD Checklist PCL]; Weathers et al., 1993) for both total scores and symptom clusters. The authors hypothesized that greater PTSD symptom instability and greater depression would be associated with poorer agreement between daily and retrospective reports. Data were collected from 132 female college students who were sexually assaulted. Multilevel modeling indicated very strong agreement between mean daily and retrospective reports for total scores and symptom clusters, with pseudo R2 ranging from .55 to .77. Depression symptoms did not moderate this association, but daily retrospective agreement was lowest for the avoidance cluster, which was also the most unstable. Finally, retrospective recall for each symptom cluster showed acceptable specificity to the corresponding daily symptom clusters. Overall, these findings suggest that retrospective memories for global PTSD symptoms and symptom clusters, as assessed by the PCL, are consistent with daily reports over a 1 month period. Implications for clinical assessment methodology are discussed. © 2012 American Psychological Association.",2012.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Participants: Patients awaiting a coronary revascularization procedure (N = 158; 20.9% female; median age = 65, interquartile range 58-73) underwent structured interview with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Patients completed a brief version of the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (i.e., Anxiety Depression Distress Inventory-27) and a measure of Type D personality. Results: Somatic anxiety scores yielded an area under the curve (AUC) = .784 and 75.0% sensitivity and 68.5% specificity in relation to panic disorder. Low positive affect yielded AUC = .811 and 70.4% sensitivity and 77.1% specificity for major depression. General distress yielded AUC = .795 and 75.0% sensitivity and 72.5% specificity for generalized anxiety disorder. No affective dimension was optimally associated with the anxious misery or visceral fear cluster. Trait negative affect was not a suitable screener for any disorder. Conclusions: The Anxiety Depression Distress Inventory-27 dimensions of low positive affect and somatic anxiety provided optimal detection of depression and panic disorder, respectively, as hypothesized, supporting discriminant validity. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2012.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,M6051,,Posttraumatic stress symptoms in the intensive care unit: Longitudinal course and effects of treatment intervention,"Objective: Although it is well established that posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) occur in patients following ICU admission, the natural prospective history of these symptoms has not been studied. There is little data on intervention studies designed to target PTSS. We report longitudinal data on the evolution of PTSS over a one-year period and examine the efficacy of a brief intervention designed to reduce trauma symptoms. Method: We examined 50 consecutive patients (mean=60.0 years SD=7.5; 60% female) admitted to an ICU for treatment of acute respiratory failure. Subjects were assessed at 8 weeks (T1), 6 months (T2) and one year (T3) after admission. After giving informed consent, subjects completed self-report measures: the PTSD Checklist (PCL-C), the HAM-D and HAM-A to assess depression and anxiety, and the GHQ-28 to assess psychiatric caseness. 25 Intervention subjects received a CD to teach progressive muscle relaxation, and instructions to do expressive writing about their ICU experience. All subjects were offered psychological support through a telephone hotline to a nurse specialist, although no subjects utilized this service. 25 Control subjects received usual care. Results: Mean scores for all subjects at T1 scored were above the clinical cut off for PTSD (>28) on the PCL-C. Subjects continued to endorse trauma symptoms at T2 and T3, Overall, intervention subjects had significantly lower scores on the GHQ, indicating more functionality, and the HAM-D/HAM-A throughout the one year study indicating an effect of the intervention. Survival analyses showed a significant difference of symptom trajectories by treatment received (P<0.05), although effect sizes of the intervention were modest (.2-.3). Conclusion: The results confirm the psychological impact of ICU admission in the aftermath of respiratory failure. Our results are in line with our previously reported high prevalence of psychopathology, specifically PTSS, but extend on this literature to show the persistence of these symptoms over time. Results also suggest that simple, brief psychological interventions may be useful to help reduce symptoms of generalized anxiety and depression in the ICU setting, however effect sizes are limited, suggesting that more targeted and intensive interventions are needed to address trauma symptoms and restore psychological functioning.",2012.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,M6021,10.1037/a0028591,The latent structure of posttraumatic stress disorder: Different models or different populations?,"Factor analytic studies of the structure of self-reported posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms have consistently supported two 4-factor models; the ""Dysphoria"" and the ""Emotional Numbing"" model. The fit of both models has been satisfactory; however, it has been difficult to unequivocally determine which model is best. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that there is no single ""correct"" model, but rather that the models represent different subpopulations. A confirmatory factor 2-class mixture model was specified with the Dysphoria model in one class and the Emotional Numbing model in the other. This model was tested using data from participants from 4 trauma groups. This model fitted the data better than 1 and 2-class models of the Dysphoria, Emotional Numbing, and cross-factor loading model.

17,M7159,,Relationship of trauma symptoms to amygdala-based functional brain changes in adolescents,"In this pilot study, amygdala connectivity related to trauma symptoms was explored using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) in 23 healthy adolescents ages 13-17 years with no psychiatric diagnoses. Adolescents completed a self-report trauma symptom checklist and a R-fMRI scan. We examined the relationship of trauma symptoms to resting-state functional connectivity of the amygdala. Increasing self-report of trauma symptoms by adolescents was associated with increasing functional connectivity with the right amygdala and a local limbic cluster and decreasing functional connectivity with the amygdala and a long-range frontoparietal cluster to the left amygdala, which can be a hallmark of immaturity. These pilot findings in adolescents provide preliminary evidence that even mild trauma symptoms can be linked to the configuration of brain networks associated with the amygdala.

19,M7359,10.2196/jmir.2460,Internet-based early intervention to prevent posttraumatic stress disorder in injury patients: randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops in 10-20% of injury patients. We developed a novel, self-guided Internet-based intervention (called Trauma TIPS) based on techniques from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to prevent the onset of PTSD symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Trauma TIPS is effective in preventing the onset of PTSD symptoms in injury patients. METHODS: Adult, level 1 trauma center patients were randomly assigned to receive the fully automated Trauma TIPS Internet intervention (n=151) or to receive no early intervention (n=149). Trauma TIPS consisted of psychoeducation, in vivo exposure, and stress management techniques. Both groups were free to use care as usual (nonprotocolized talks with hospital staff). PTSD symptom severity was assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post injury with a clinical interview (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale) by blinded trained interviewers and self-report instrument (Impact of Event Scale-Revised). Secondary outcomes were acute anxiety and arousal (assessed online), self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and mental health care utilization. Intervention usage was documented. RESULTS: The mean number of intervention logins was 1.7, SD 2.5, median 1, interquartile range (IQR) 1-2. Thirty-four patients in the intervention group did not log in (22.5%), 63 (41.7%) logged in once, and 54 (35.8%) logged in multiple times (mean 3.6, SD 3.5, median 3, IQR 2-4). On clinician-assessed and self-reported PTSD symptoms, both the intervention and control group showed a significant decrease over time (P<.001) without significant differences in trend. PTSD at 12 months was diagnosed in 4.7% of controls and 4.4% of intervention group patients. There were no group differences on anxiety or depressive symptoms over time. Post hoc analyses using latent growth mixture modeling showed a significant decrease in PTSD symptoms in a subgroup of patients with severe initial symptoms (n=20) (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support the efficacy of the Trauma TIPS Internet-based early intervention in the prevention of PTSD symptoms for an unselected population of injury patients. Moreover, uptake was relatively low since one-fifth of individuals did not log in to the intervention. Future research should therefore focus on innovative strategies to increase intervention usage, for example, adding gameplay, embedding it in a blended care context, and targeting high-risk individuals who are more likely to benefit from the intervention.

20,M5976,10.1017/dmp.2013.21,Trauma signature analysis of the great East Japan disaster: guidance for psychological consequences,"OBJECTIVES: On March 11, 2011, Japan experienced the largest earthquake in its history. The undersea earthquake launched a tsunami that inundated much of Japan's eastern coastline and damaged nuclear power plants, precipitating multiple reactor meltdowns. We examined open-source disaster situation reports, news accounts, and disaster-monitoring websites to gather event-specific data to conduct a trauma signature analysis of the event. METHODS: The trauma signature analysis included a review of disaster situation reports; the construction of a hazard profile for the earthquake, tsunami, and radiation threats; enumeration of disaster stressors by disaster phase; identification of salient evidence-based psychological risk factors; summation of the trauma signature based on exposure to hazards, loss, and change; and review of the mental health and psychosocial support responses in relation to the analysis. RESULTS: Exposure to this triple-hazard event resulted in extensive damage, significant loss of life, and massive population displacement. Many citizens were exposed to multiple hazards. The extremity of these exposures was partially mitigated by Japan's timely, expert-coordinated, and unified activation of an evidence-based mental health response. CONCLUSIONS: The eastern Japan disaster was notable for its unique constellation of compounding exposures. Examination of the trauma signature of this event provided insights and guidance regarding optimal mental health and psychosocial responses. Japan orchestrated a model response that reinforced community resilience.",2013.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,M6809,10.1017/S0033291712002309,"Subsyndromal depression in the United States: prevalence, course, and risk for incident psychiatric outcomes","BACKGROUND: Subsyndromal depression (SD) may increase risk for incident major depressive and other disorders, as well as suicidality. However, little is known about the prevalence, course, and correlates of SD in the US general adult population. Method Structured diagnostic interviews were conducted to assess DSM-IV Axis I and II disorders in a nationally representative sample of 34 653 US adults who were interviewed at two time-points 3 years apart. RESULTS: A total of 11.6% of US adults met study criteria for lifetime SD at Wave 1. The majority (9.3%) had <5 total symptoms required for a diagnosis of major depression; the remainder (2.3%) reported ⩾5 symptoms required for a diagnosis of major depression, but denied clinically significant distress or functional impairment. SD at Wave 1 was associated with increased likelihood of developing incident major depression odds ratios (ORs) 1.72-2.05], as well as dysthymia, social phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) at Wave 2 (ORs 1.41-2.92). Among respondents with SD at Wave 1, Cluster A and B personality disorders, and worse mental health status were associated with increased likelihood of developing incident major depression at Wave 2. CONCLUSIONS: SD is prevalent in the US population, and associated with elevated rates of Axis I and II psychopathology, increased psychosocial disability, and risk for incident major depression, dysthymia, social phobia, and GAD. These results underscore the importance of a dimensional conceptualization of depressive symptoms, as SD may serve as an early prognostic indicator of incident major depression and related disorders, and could help identify individuals who may benefit from preventive interventions.",2013.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,M6799,10.1037/a0033942,"Psychophysiologic reactivity, subjective distress, and their associations with PTSD diagnosis","Intense subjective distress and physiologic reactivity upon exposure to reminders of the traumatic event are each diagnostic features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, subjective reports and psychophysiological data often suggest different conclusions. For the present study, we combined data from five previous studies to assess the contributions of these two types of measures in predicting PTSD diagnosis. One hundred fifty trauma-exposed participants who were classified into PTSD or non-PTSD groups based on structured diagnostic interviews completed the same script-driven imagery procedure, which quantified measures of psychophysiologic reactivity and self-reported emotional responses. We derived four discriminant functions (DiscFxs) that each maximally separated the PTSD from the non-PTSD group using (1) psychophysiologic measures recorded during personal mental imagery of the traumatic event; (2) self-report ratings in response to the trauma imagery; (3) psychophysiologic measures recorded during personal mental imagery of another highly stressful experience unrelated to the index traumatic event; and (4) self-report ratings in response to this other stressor. When PTSD status was simultaneously regressed on all four DiscFxs, trauma-related psychophysiological reactivity was a significant predictor, but physiological reactivity resulting from the highly stressful, but not traumatic script, was not. Self-reported distress to the traumatic experience and the other stressful event were both predictive of PTSD diagnosis. Trauma-related psychophysiologic reactivity was the best predictor of PTSD diagnosis, but self-reported distress contributed additional variance. These results are discussed in relation to the Research Domain Criteria framework. © 2013 American Psychological Association.",2013.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,M5963,10.1037/a0030144,Reductions in traumatic stress following a coping intervention were mediated by decreases in avoidant coping for people living with HIV/AIDS and childhood sexual abuse,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether (a) Living in the Face of Trauma (LIFT), a group intervention to address coping with HIV and childhood sexual abuse (CSA), significantly reduced traumatic stress over a 1-year follow-up period more than an attention-matched support group comparison intervention; and (b) reductions in avoidant coping over time mediated reductions in traumatic stress. METHOD: In a randomized controlled trial, 247 participants completed measures of traumatic stress and avoidant coping at pre- and post intervention, and at 4-, 8-, and 12-month follow-ups. Latent growth curve modeling examined changes over the 5 time points; standardized path coefficients provide estimates of effects. RESULTS: As compared with the support intervention, the coping intervention led to a reduction in traumatic stress over time (b = -.20, p < .02). Participants in the coping intervention also reduced their use of avoidant coping strategies more than did participants in the support intervention (b = -.22, p < .05). Mediation analyses showed reductions in avoidant coping related to reductions in traumatic stress (b = 1.45, p < .001), and the direct effect of the intervention on traumatic stress was no longer significant (b = .04, ns), suggesting that changes in avoidant coping completely mediated intervention effects on traumatic stress. CONCLUSIONS: The LIFT intervention significantly reduced traumatic stress over time, and changes in avoidant coping strategies mediated this effect, suggesting a focus on current stressors and coping skills improvement are important components in addressing traumatic stress for adults living with HIV and CSA.",2013.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,M6590,10.1186/1129-2377-14-22,Personality traits in chronic daily headache patients with and without psychiatric comorbidity: An observational study in a tertiary care headache center,"Background: Previous studies suggest that patients with Chronic Daily Headache (CDH) have higher levels of anxiety and depressive disorders than patients with episodic migraine or tension-type headache. However, no study has considered the presence of psychiatric comorbidity in the analysis of personality traits. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity and specific personality traits in CDH patients, exploring if specific personality traits are associated to headache itself or to the psychiatric comorbidity associated with headache. Methods: An observational, cross-sectional study. Ninety-four CDH patients with and without medication overuse were included in the study and assessed by clinical psychiatric interview and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) as diagnostic tools. Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) were afterwards administered. Patients with and without psychiatric comorbidity were compared. Further analyses were made by splitting the whole group according to the headache diagnosis and the presence or not of medication overuse. Results: Psychiatric comorbidity was detected in 44 patients (46.8%) (group A) and was absent in the remaining 50 patients (53.2%) (group B). Mood and anxiety disorders were the most frequently diagnosed (43.6%). In the overall group, mean scores of MMPI-2 showed a high level in the so-called neurotic triad; in particular the mean score in the Hypochondriasis subscale was in the pathologic area (73.55 ± 13.59), while Depression and Hysteria scores were moderate but not severe (62.53 and 61.61, respectively). In content scales, score in Health Concern was also high (66.73). Group A presented higher scores compared to Group B in the following MMPI-2 subscales: Hypochondriasis (p =.036), Depression (p =.032), Hysteria (p <.0001), Hypomania (p =.030). Group B had a high score only in the Hypochondriasis subscale. No significant differences were found between chronic migraine (CM)-probable CM (pCM) plus probable medication overuse headache (pMOH) and chronic tension-type headache (CTTH)-probable CTTH (pCTTH) plus pMOH patients or between patients with and without drug overuse. Conclusions: The so-called “Neurotic Profile” reached clinical level only in CDH patients with psychiatric comorbidity while a high concern about their general health status was a common feature in all CDH patients.",2013.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,M7831,10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60354-2,Violent offending by UK military personnel deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan: A data linkage cohort study,"Background Violent offending by veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts is a cause for concern and there is much public debate about the proportion of ex-military personnel in the criminal justice system for violent offences. Although the psychological effects of conflict are well documented, the potential legacy of violent offending has yet to be ascertained. We describe our use of criminal records to investigate the effect of deployment, combat, and postdeployment mental health problems on violent offending among military personnel relative to pre-existing risk factors. Methods In this cohort study, we linked data from 13 856 randomly selected, serving and ex-serving UK military personnel with national criminal records stored on the Ministry of Justice Police National Computer database. We describe offending during the lifetime of the participants and assess the risk factors for violent offending. Findings 2139 (weighted 17•0%) of 12 359 male UK military personnel had a criminal record for any offence during their lifetime. Violent offenders (1369 11•0%]) were the most prevalent offender types; prevalence was highest in men aged 30 years or younger (521 20•6%] of 2728) and fell with age (164 4•7%] of 3027 at age >45 years). Deployment was not independently associated with increased risk of violent offending, but serving in a combat role conferred an additional risk, even after adjustment for confounders (violent offending in 137 6•3%] of 2178 men deployed in a combat role vs 140 (2•4%) of 5797 deployed in a non-combat role; adjusted hazard ratio 1•53, 95% CI 1•15-2•03; p=0•003). Increased exposure to traumatic events during deployment also increased risk of violent offending (violent offending in 104 4•1%] of 2753 men with exposure to two to four traumatic events vs 56 1•6%] of 2944 with zero to one traumatic event, 1•77, 1•21-2•58, p=0•003; and violent offending in 122 5•1%] of 2582 men with exposure to five to 16 traumatic events, 1•65, 1•12-2•40, p=0•01; test for trend, p=0•032). Violent offending was strongly associated with post-deployment alcohol misuse (violent offending in 120 9•0%] of 1363 men with alcohol misuse vs 155 2•3%] of 6768 with no alcohol misuse; 2•16, 1•62-2•90; p<0•0001), post-traumatic stress disorder (violent offending in 25 8•6%] of 344 men with post-traumatic stress disorder vs 221 3•0%] of 7256 with no symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder; 2•20, 1•36-3•55; p=0•001), and high levels of self-reported aggressive behaviour (violent offending in 56 6•7%] of 856 men with an aggression score of six to 16 vs 22 1•2%] of 1685 with an aggression score of zero; 2•47, 1•37-4•46; p=0•003). Of the post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, the hyperarousal cluster was most strongly associated with violent offending (2•01, 1•50-2•70; p<0•0001). Interpretation Alcohol misuse and aggressive behaviour might be appropriate targets for interventions, but any action must be evidence based. Post-traumatic stress disorder, though less prevalent, is also a risk factor for violence, especially hyperarousal symptoms, so if diagnosed it should be appropriately treated and associated risk monitored.

26,M5896,10.1007/s00127-013-0709-8,The role of stress sensitization in progression of posttraumatic distress following deployment,"PURPOSE: Military personnel exposed to combat are at risk for experiencing post-traumatic distress that can progress over time following deployment. We hypothesized that progression of post-traumatic distress may be related to enhanced susceptibility to post-deployment stressors. This study aimed at examining the concept of stress sensitization prospectively in a sample of Dutch military personnel deployed in support of the conflicts in Afghanistan. METHOD: In a cohort of soldiers (N = 814), symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were assessed before deployment as well as 2, 7, 14, and 26 months (N = 433; 53 %) after their return. Data were analyzed using latent growth modeling. Using multiple group analysis, we examined whether high combat stress exposure during deployment moderated the relation between post-deployment stressors and linear change in post-traumatic distress after deployment. RESULTS: A higher baseline level of post-traumatic distress was associated with more early life stressors (standardized regression coefficient = 0.30, p < 0.001). In addition, a stronger increase in posttraumatic distress during deployment was associated with more deployment stressors (standardized coefficient = 0.21, p < 0.001). A steeper linear increase in posttraumatic distress post-deployment (from 2 to 26 months) was predicted by more post-deployment stressors (standardized coefficient = 0.29, p < 0.001) in high combat stress exposed soldiers, but not in a less combat stress exposed group. The group difference in the predictive effect of post-deployment stressors on progression of post-traumatic distress was significant (χ2(1) = 7.85, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Progression of post-traumatic distress following combat exposure may be related to sensitization to the effects of post-deployment stressors during the first year following return from deployment.",2013.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,M7817,,A socio-interpersonal perspective on PTSD: the case for environments and interpersonal processes,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common reaction to traumatic experiences. We propose a socio-interpersonal model of PTSD that complements existing models of post-traumatic memory processes or neurobiological changes. The model adds an interpersonal perspective to explain responses to traumatic stress. The framework draws from lifespan psychology, cultural psychology and research into close relationships and groups. Additionally, clinical knowledge about PTSD is incorporated. This involves knowledge about shame, guilt, estrangement feelings and protective factors, such as social support and forgiveness. Three levels are proposed at which relevant interpersonal processes can be situated and should be adequately researched. First, the individual level comprises social affective states, such as shame, guilt, anger and feelings of revenge. Second, at the close relationship level, social support, negative exchange (ostracism and blaming the victim), disclosure and empathy are proposed as dyadic processes relevant to PTSD research and treatment. Third, the distant social level represents culture and society, in which the collectivistic nature of trauma, perceived injustice, and social acknowledgement are concepts that predict the response trajectories to traumatic stress. Research by the current authors and others is cited in an effort to promote future investigation based on the current model. Methodological implications, such as multi-level data analyses, and clinical implications, such as the need for couple, community or larger-level societal interventions, are both outlined. The socio-interpersonal model proposes an interpersonal view of the processes that occur in the aftermath of a traumatic experience. At the individual level, the model integrates the social affective phenomena that clinical research identifies in PTSD patients, including shame, guilt, anger, revenge and the urges or reluctance to disclose. At the level of close relationships, there is an emphasis on the role of the individuals' partner, family or social support in the development or maintenance of PTSD and its recovery. At the distant social level, societal and cultural factors, e.g., individualistic versus collectivistic or other human value orientations, are acknowledged as contributing to the severity and course of PTSD. Increasing attention should be given to new approaches of PTSD treatment that refer to an interpersonal view of PTSD, e.g., communication training, PTSD-specific couples' therapy or community programs.

28,M9378,,Predictors of suicidal ideation in a gender-stratified sample of OEF/OIF veterans,"There is a growing concern about suicide among Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) veterans. We examined the role of postdeployment mental health in associations between deployment stressors and postdeployment suicidal ideation (SI) in a national sample of 2,321 female and male OEF/OIF veterans. Data were obtained via survey, and path analysis was used. For women and men, mental health symptoms largely accounted for associations between deployment stressors and SI; however, they only partly accounted for the sexual harassment and SI association among women. These findings enhance the understanding of the mental health profile of OEF/OIF veterans. Published 2013.

29,M9518,,A longitudinal study of changes in psychological responses to continuous terrorism,"OBJECTIVE: The impact of ongoing terror over time has received little attention. This study assesses longitudinally prevalence and predictors of posttraumatic stress symptoms' trajectories, namely resistance, resilience, late-onset and chronicity in the course of intensive and ongoing terror. METHOD: Two surveys were performed at a two-year interval among 153 Jewish Israeli adults. RESULTS: Results show probable PTSD prevalence, number of traumatic stress related symptoms (TSRS), and rate of severe posttraumatic symptomatology (PTSS) to increase over time (from 18.2% to 31.2%). With this, many (66.7% of those with PTSD and 39.3% of those with PTSS at wave 1) recovered. Late-onset of severe PTSS (19.6% of the sample) was predicted by income reduction, a major lifetime traumatic event, sense of threat, dissociation, coping via disengagement and low mood. Chronicity was predicted by sense of threat, pessimism, dissociation and disengagement. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous exposure to terror has a strong negative impact on mental health. Secondly, even within a chronic situation of terror, a large proportion of individuals with elevated levels of posttraumatic symptomatology recover over time; third, prolonged exposure to terror may also exacerbate symptomatology, but not per-se trigger new PTSD cases.",2013.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,M8773,,Family presence during cardiopulmonary resuscitation,"Study objectives: Family presence during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) of a loved one remains controversial. Our study aimed to determine if offering a relative the choice to observe CPR of a family member might reduce his psychological impact 90 days later. Methods: A multicenter, cluster randomized, controlled trial. We enrolled 570 relatives of patients who were in cardiac arrest in 17 prehospital emergency medical services. Centers were randomized either to 1) systematically offer the family member the opportunity to observe CPR (intervention group) or 2) to the habitual practice regarding family presence (control group). The primary endpoint was the proportion of relatives having post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related symptoms by an Impact of Event Scale (IES)>30 at 90 days. Secondary endpoints were the presence of anxiety and depression symptoms and impact of family presence on medical efforts at resuscitation, wellbeing of the healthcare team, and on the occurrence of medicolegal claims. Analyses used the Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). Results: 211/266 (79%) relatives witnessed CPR (intervention group) compared to 131/304 (43%) relatives (control group). In the intention-to-treat analysis, family members had PTSD-related symptoms significantly more frequently in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval CI], 1.2-2.5; P=0.004) and when they did not witness CPR (adjusted odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.5; P=0.02). According to family presence, relatives who did not witness CPR had more frequently symptoms of anxiety and depression. Family-witnessed CPR did not affect resuscitation characteristics, patient survival, medical team stress or result in medicolegal claims. Conclusions: Our results promote family presence during CPR. This experience was associated with positive results on psychological parameters and neither interfered with medical efforts or health care team stress nor resulted in medicolegal conflicts.",2013.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Descriptive statistics were calculated for data reflecting use of the SEIQoL-DW alongside demographic and outcome variables. PURPOSE: To examine both the feasibility of applying the Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life-Direct Weighting procedure (SEIQoL-DW) as a routine outcome measure within an early intervention service for young people with indicated personality disorder and the overall quality of life (QoL) in this population. RESULTS: The SEIQoL-DW was administered to 52 young adults with indicated personality disorder, with 47 completing the measure, taking an average time of 27 min. Individual QoL was poor with a mean global index score of 55.07 (SD = 22.34). Individual QoL areas formed five main domains-'Aspects of Daily Living', 'Relationships', 'Social Life and Leisure', 'Family' and 'Emotional and Physical Wellbeing'. CONCLUSION: This study further extends the application of the SEIQoL-DW for use as a routine outcome measure within a busy service setting, although ways to accommodate administration time need to be considered.

32,M9677,10.1093/jpepsy/jst015,Trauma reactions in mothers and fathers after their infant's cardiac surgery,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and nature of trauma symptoms in mothers and fathers of infants who had cardiac surgery. METHOD: Parents of infants who underwent cardiac surgery before 3 months of age were recruited at the time of surgery. 77 mothers and 55 fathers completed the Acute Stress Disorder Scale 1 month after their infant was discharged from hospital. RESULTS: 26 of 77 (33.8%) mothers and 10 of 55 (18.2%) fathers satisfied criteria for acute stress disorder. For all symptom clusters, except dissociation, mothers had significantly higher mean scores (and therefore higher levels of symptoms) than did fathers, ps = .01, -.02. 83 percent of parents endorsed at least 1 trauma symptom and 11.4% endorsed only 1 symptom at a clinical level. Symptoms of dissociation were the most commonly endorsed by both parents, with each symptom in that cluster being endorsed at a clinical level by at least 26% of parents. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with our hypotheses, approximately one-third of parents overall, as well as one-third of mothers and close to one-fifth of fathers, experienced trauma symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of acute stress disorder. Most parents experienced at least one symptom at a clinical level, with symptoms of dissociation being the most commonly endorsed symptom cluster.

BACKGROUND: Successful treatment of PTSD with SGB has been demonstrated and reported previously at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. An identical protocol was used at Tripler Army Medical Center to treat four service members diagnosed with combat-related PTSD. METHODS: All patients reported received an SGB on the right side at the level of C6. The patient's PTSD symptoms were evaluated using the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL). This checklist was distributed one day before treatment and again the day following treatment. The patients were also given the PCL at subsequent follow-up visits to quantify sustained benefit. RESULTS: SGB showed acute benefit for the symptoms of PTSD by markedly reduced PCL scores after the procedure. Benefits were also sustained during close outpatient follow-up. CONCLUSION: Selective blockade of the right stellate ganglion at C6 is a minimally invasive procedure with an excellent safety profile that may provide sustained relief of PTSD symptoms. The procedure may also provide benefit for those who are resistant to psychotropic intervention.,2013.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,M9360,,Patterns of multiple victimization among maltreated children in Navy families,"The current study examined the cumulative risk associated with children's exposure to multiple types of parent-inflicted victimization. The sample was comprised of 195 children who were 7 to 17 years old (64.1% female and 48.2% non-White) at the time of referral to the United States Navy's Family Advocacy Program due to allegations of sexual abuse, physical abuse, or parental intimate partner violence. We conducted an exploratory latent class analysis to identify distinct subgroups of children based on lifetime victimization. We hypothesized that at least 2 classes or subgroups would be identified, with 1 characterized by greater victimization and poorer outcomes. Results indicated that 3 classes of children best fit the data: (a) high victimization across all 3 categories, (b) high rates of physical abuse and witnessing intimate partner violence, and (c) high rates of physical abuse only. Findings indicated that the high victimization class was at greatest risk for alcohol and substance use, delinquent behavior, and meeting criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or depression 1 year later (odds ratio = 4.53). These findings highlight the serious mental health needs of a small but significantly high-risk portion of multiply victimized children entering the child welfare system.

The purpose of this study was to investigate positive and negative affect as predictors of adults' ratings of both the childhood and adult impact of their childhood adversity. Self-report data on ACE experiences, including number, severity, and 'impact' were collected from 158 community members recruited on the basis of having adverse childhood experiences. Results indicated that, regardless of event severity and number of different types of adverse events experienced, high levels of negative affect were the strongest predictor of whether the adult impact of the adverse childhood events was rated as negative.

36,M8378,10.1037/a0031290,Cognitive change predicts symptom reduction with cognitive therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder,"OBJECTIVE: There is a growing body of evidence for the effectiveness of trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but few studies to date have investigated the mechanisms by which TF-CBT leads to therapeutic change. Models of PTSD suggest that a core treatment mechanism is the change in dysfunctional appraisals of the trauma and its aftermath. If this is the case, then changes in appraisals should predict a change in symptoms. The present study investigated whether cognitive change precedes symptom change in Cognitive Therapy for PTSD, a version of TF-CBT. METHOD: The study analyzed weekly cognitive and symptom measures from 268 PTSD patients who received a course of Cognitive Therapy for PTSD, using bivariate latent growth modeling. RESULTS: Results showed that (a) dysfunctional trauma-related appraisals and PTSD symptoms both decreased significantly over the course of treatment, (b) changes in appraisals and symptoms were correlated, and (c) weekly change in appraisals significantly predicted subsequent reduction in symptom scores (both corrected for the general decrease over the course of therapy). Changes in PTSD symptom severity did not predict subsequent changes in appraisals. CONCLUSIONS: The study provided preliminary evidence for the temporal precedence of a reduction in negative trauma-related appraisals in symptom reduction during trauma-focused CBT for PTSD. This supports the role of change in appraisals as an active therapeutic mechanism.",2013.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,M10746,10.1038/npp.2014.282,"Pre-, peri-, and post-deployment trajectories of health over four years of follow-up in the Ohio army national guard mental health initiative (OHARNG-MHI)","Background: The burden of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in the military is well documented and co-occurring alcohol misuse is common, but few studies have documented longitudinal trajectories of these disorders, and none have considered how co-occurring alcohol misuse modifies these trajectories. The primary aim of the OHARNG-MHI is to examine the role of pre-, peri-, and post-deployment experiences, both military and civilian, in jointly contributing to trajectories of psychopathology, psychological adjustment, and resilience. This particular analysis identifies vulnerable subgroups by studying trajectories of depression and PTSD symptoms after deployment across four waves. Methods: Among 3457 subjects enrolled into Waves 1-4 from 2008-2012, a cohort of 1199 were identified as having completed at least two study waves, being deployed within two years of baseline, and having experienced a traumatic event. All subjects with depression, with or without PTSD (n=727), completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9); those who also had co-occurring PTSD completed the PTSD Checklist (PCL). Subjects with PTSD (n=472) completed both the PHQ-9 and the PCL using the same traumatic event defined as their worst of all study waves. Time-stable risk factors at baseline (area of conflict to which the soldier was deployed in their most recent deployment, low education/income, childhood adversity, marital status, 10+lifetime traumas, 4+lifetime stressful events) and time-varying covariates (past-year alcohol misuse, past-year PTSD, past-year depression, and cumulative traumas and stressors) were used to identify membership into different latent trajectory groups and to assess the effect of alcohol misuse on observed trajectories. Using the PHQ-9, depression symptoms were modeled assuming a zero-inflated Poisson distribution in the 727 soldiers. PTSD symptoms were modeled assuming a censored normal distribution using the PTSD Check List symptom scale in 472 soldiers and were questioned about the same worst index event throughout all follow-up interviews. Alcohol misuse was defined as having either past-year abuse or dependence defined by the DSM-IV. SAS-callable proc traj was used to estimate output trajectories. PTSD diagnosis at each time point was used as a time-varying covariate to see if it significantly altered outcome, and conversely, depression at each time point was used as a covariate in the PTSD trajectories. Results: Following combat trauma and after the follow-up period, 46% of soldiers were resistant to the development of PTSD symptoms, 38% experienced mild PTSD symptoms that remitted, 11% mild chronic PTSD symptoms, and 5% chronic moderately severe PTSD. Vulnerable subgroups were identifiable at baseline as low income, low education, and high number of lifetime traumatic events. 55% of soldiers were resistant to the development of depressive symptoms, 20% experienced remitting mild depression symptoms, 13% displayed delayed onset of two symptoms of depression, and 12% showed chronic dysfunction. Trajectories of Depression: Baseline lifetime stressors predicted chronic dysfunction three-fold. The absence of childhood trauma, not being married/being single, not being deployed to a conflict area, and having few lifetime stressors were associated with resistance to the development of depressive symptoms. Whereas the addition of alcohol abuse or dependence had no effect on the 55% who were resistant to depression symptoms across all four waves, all other subgroups misusing alcohol experienced a worsening of depressive symptoms. Of the 727, the 13% who were resistant at month 7 and only worsened minimally over the 45 months were particularly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of alcohol misuse, which resulted in a 180% increase in depression symptoms across the four waves; the two remaining trajectory groups showed moderate increases in symptomology. Trajectories of PTSD: A high level of potentially traumatic events at baseline made soldiers nearly 12 times more likely to fall into the chronic dysfunction group. Being deployed to an area of conflict was associated with constant mild symptoms. Of the 472, 46% experienced no PTSD symptoms at month 7 and went on to be completely resistant to the development of PTSD symptoms at all four time points. 38% had mild subsyndromal symptoms that gradually remitted over 45 weeks, 11% who had persistent constant mild symptoms of PTSD continued to do so, and 5% who had severe chronic symptoms worsened over time. The impact of those misusing alcohol was compared to those not misusing alcohol. The addition of alcohol misuse mildly worsened subjects in all four groups, with the largest effect being a 9. Conclusions: Most soldiers fell into the low-symptoms groups and were resistant to both PTSD and depression. The primary predictors of chronic dysfunction were low income, low education, and a high number of lifetime traumas and stressors. The potential influence of lifetime risk factors on trajectories suggests that a life course perspective (including pre-, peri-, postdeployment inquiry) is critical in the investigation of psychopathology in service members.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,M6825,10.1177/2050640614548980,Combat-training stress mediates metabotypic changes associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and altered intestinal permeability,"INTRODUCTION: Physical and psychological stress have been shown to precipitate gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and impair intestinal barrier function. The neuroendocrine and -immune axes, as well as probably modulation of the microbiome, are involved mechanisms, but the molecular basis of stress-induced GI manifestations remains elusive. Global urinary metabolic profiling represents a novel approach for interrogating the multiparametric metabolic fluxes that occur in response to pathophysiologic stimuli such as stress. AIMS & METHODS: Here, we characterized the stress-induced metabolic phenotype (metabotype) in soldiers during high-intensity combat-training and correlated the metabotype with changes in GI physiology, particularly the development of GI symptoms and alteration in intestinal permeability. In a prospective, longitudinal study, urinary metabotyping was conducted on 38 male soldiers (ages 19-23) during combat training and the subsequent rest period using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Stress was measured using the perceived stress scale-10 item (PSS-10) questionnaire, while incidence and severity of GI symptoms were assessed using the irritable bowel syndrome symptom severity score (IBS-SSS). Whole gut intestinal permeability was evaluated by quantifying the 24h urinary excretion of sucralose as a percentage of the orally administered 1g dose. RESULTS: PSS-10 stress and IBS-SSS scores were higher during the combattraining period than at rest. The urinary metabotype was clearly distinct from the rest period partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) R2X=0.386, R2Y=0.712, Q2 (cumulative)=0.563], confirming the presence of a unique stress-induced metabotype. Based on PLSDA, differential metabolites related to combat stress were uncovered (e.g. elevated pyroglutamate and fructose; reduced gut microbial metabolites such as hippurate and m-hydroxyphenylacetate) p<0.05]. The extent of pyroglutamate upregulation exhibited a positive correlation with the increase in IBS-SSS in soldiers during combat-training r=0.504, p<0.05]. Additionally, the rise in fructose levels during combat-training was positively correlated with an increase in intestinal permeability r=0.630, p<0.005]. CONCLUSION: Protracted and mixed psychological and physical combat-training stress yielded unique metabolic changes that corresponded with the incidence and severity of GI symptoms and alteration in intestinal permeability. Taken together, our data provided new insights into the molecular changes underlying stress-induced GI perturbations which could be exploited for future biomarker research or therapeutic strategies.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,M8939,10.1111/jcpp.12241,Different clinical courses of children exposed to a single incident of psychological trauma: a 30-month prospective follow-up study,"BACKGROUND: We investigated the distinct longitudinal trajectories of posttraumatic stress symptoms in a sample of 167 children, who witnessed death of two mothers of their schoolmates. METHODS: The cohort was followed-up at 2 days (T1), 2 months (T2), 6 months (T3), and 30 months (T4) after the traumatic event. The children's posttraumatic stress symptoms (T1-T4), depression (T1, T3 and T4), state anxiety (T1, T3 and T4), and quality of life (T4) were assessed, along with parental stress related to child rearing (T4). Different trajectory patterns of the children's posttraumatic stress symptoms were identified using growth mixture modeling (GMM). RESULTS: Four different patterns of symptom change were identified, which were consistent with the prototypical model, and were named Recovery (19.9%), Resilience (72.7%), Chronic Dysfunction (1.8%), and Delayed Reactions (5.6%). Significant differences were found in depression and anxiety scores, children's quality of life, and parental rearing stress according to the distinct longitudinal trajectories of posttraumatic stress symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that individual differences should be taken into account in the clinical course and outcome of children exposed to psychological trauma. The two most common trajectories were the Resilience and the Recovery types, together suggesting that over 90% of children were evidenced with a favorable 30-month outcome. The latent classes were associated with significant mean differences in depression and anxiety scores, supporting the clinical validity of the distinct trajectories.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,M10828,10.1111/sbr.12082,Male south Sudanese Australians are at high risk for sleep and psychological difficulties,"Background: Women in Western countries are more likely to report insomnia (e.g. Zhang & Wing, 2006) and mood disorders (e.g. Kuehner, 2003) than men. Further, a meta-analysis found women were more likely to meet the criteria for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) than men (Tolin & Foa 2006). However, it is unknown whether such sex differences in reported sleep difficulties and PTSD symptoms also apply to those from non-Western countries who have settled in Australia. Methods: The questionnaire included 14 sleep related items, the K10 (psychological distress) and the PSQI-Addendum for PTSD symptoms. It was administered individually in Dinka, Nuer, English or Arabic across Victoria by PhD students from the South Sudanese community. The final sample (n = 117, aged 16-60 years, 53% male) was broadly representative of the age profile of adult South Sudanese Australians (SSA) and the average length of time of living in Australia was 10 years. Over two thirds of SSA males had completed a TAFE/Technical/ Apprentice or University qualification and about 30% were seeking work. Comparisons were made with a national Australian sleep survey report (Hillman and Lack, 2013) and, for psychological distress, the Victorian Population Survey (2010). Results: SSA males were about five times more likely to be classified with 'severe clinical insomnia' than both males in the broad Australian community and SSA females. Rates for difficulty with waking up too early, restless legs, pauses in breathing in sleep, fatigue/exhaustion and daytime sleepiness were two to four times that reported by both a broad sample of male Australians and SSA females. Over 40% of SSA males reported significant daytime impairments due to poor sleep. Nearly one in five SSA males met the criteria for 'severe psychological distress', a rate 10 times higher than found in Victorian males and twice as high as in SSA females. Of particular concern is that 57% of SSA males met the criteria for PTSD, a rate three times that of their female counterparts. Conclusion: Males within the South Sudanese Australian community report hitherto unrecognised significant problems with their sleep and psychological adjustment. The reason for these sex differences are unclear but may relate to SSA women being able to negotiate the uncertainties of resettlement more successfully.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,M6810,,Trajectories of PTSD risk and resilience in World Trade Center responders: an 8-year prospective cohort study,"Longitudinal symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are often characterized by heterogeneous trajectories, which may have unique pre-, peri- and post-trauma risk and protective factors. To date, however, no study has evaluated the nature and determinants of predominant trajectories of PTSD symptoms in World Trade Center (WTC) responders. A total of 10835 WTC responders, including 4035 professional police responders and 6800 non-traditional responders (e.g. construction workers) who participated in the WTC Health Program (WTC-HP), were evaluated an average of 3, 6 and 8 years after the WTC attacks. Among police responders, longitudinal PTSD symptoms were best characterized by four classes, with the majority (77.8%) in a resistant/resilient trajectory and the remainder exhibiting chronic (5.3%), recovering (8.4%) or delayed-onset (8.5%) symptom trajectories. Among non-traditional responders, a six-class solution was optimal, with fewer responders in a resistant/resilient trajectory (58.0%) and the remainder exhibiting recovering (12.3%), severe chronic (9.5%), subsyndromal increasing (7.3%), delayed-onset (6.7%) and moderate chronic (6.2%) trajectories. Prior psychiatric history, Hispanic ethnicity, severity of WTC exposure and WTC-related medical conditions were most strongly associated with symptomatic trajectories of PTSD symptoms in both groups of responders, whereas greater education and family and work support while working at the WTC site were protective against several of these trajectories. Trajectories of PTSD symptoms in WTC responders are heterogeneous and associated uniquely with pre-, peri- and post-trauma risk and protective factors. Police responders were more likely than non-traditional responders to exhibit a resistant/resilient trajectory. These results underscore the importance of prevention, screening and treatment efforts that target high-risk disaster responders, particularly those with prior psychiatric history, high levels of trauma exposure and work-related medical morbidities.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,M8177,10.1002/jclp.22092,Substantial symptom changes in naturalistic recovery from aversive events,"OBJECTIVE: Researchers have recommended examining trajectories of recovery from aversive events, including sudden gains and spikes. We examined rates, attributions for, and outcomes associated with substantial symptom improvements and brief exacerbations after aversive events. METHOD: Sixty-three women completed questionnaire measures of mood, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. They used a Life History Calendar (LHC) to draw the trajectory of symptom levels from the event to the present, and were interviewed regarding the course of their symptoms. Based on the LHC and interview, we coded whether each participant experienced substantial improvements and/or brief exacerbations and reasons for them. RESULTS: Participants frequently experienced substantial improvements and brief exacerbations, most of which they attributed to external events. Substantial improvements-but not substantial brief exacerbations-were associated with significantly lower symptom levels. CONCLUSION: Substantial improvements are similar to sudden gains in therapy samples. Substantial improvements in avoidance and mood have positive, bidirectional effects on each other.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,M10889,10.7196/SAJP.664,Is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with symmetry symptomatology a distinct OCD subtype?,"Background. In obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), symmetry concerns are common. In addition to evidence for links with several demographic and clinical features such as male gender, earlier age of onset of OCD, and comorbidity with tic disorders and obsessivecompulsive personality disorder (OCPD), symmetry symptomatology may also have specific psychobiological underpinnings. This investigation furthers previous work by examining demographic, clinical and genetic correlates of symmetry in OCD. A distinctive genotype distribution profile may provide support for OCD with symmetry symptomatology as a distinct OCD subtype. Method. OCD patients (N=573) with ages ranging from 8 to 75 years, underwent a comprehensive clinical assessment that included the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis of Axis I disorders (Patient version) (SCID-I/P), and the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Symptom Checklist and Severity Scale (Y-BOCS). DNA extracted from venous blood (10 - 30 mL) in a white subset (n=445) with current symmetry concerns (n=293 (65.8%)) and those without (n=152 (34.2%)) was genotyped to investigate polymorphisms in dopaminergic genes previously hypothesised to be relevant to symmetry. Results. OCD patients with symmetry obsessions and related compulsions comprised 66.1% of the total sample. Compared with those without, those with symmetry symptomatology had significantly earlier age of onset of OCD, higher OCD severity scores, longer illness duration, worse functional impairment, increased dissociation and higher rates of emotional abuse during childhood. OCD symmetry symptomatology was also significantly associated with comorbid dysthymic disorder, alcohol abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder (PSTD), bulimia and anorexia nervosa, self-injury, compulsive shopping, and obsessive-compulsive and borderline personality disorders. We found no statistically significant associations between symmetry symptomatology and COMT (rs4680), DRD1 (rs4532), DRD2 (rs1800497), DRD3 (rs6280), the 40bp (DAT) and 48bp (DRD4) VNTRs, and MAOA (rs1137070). Conclusion. Our investigation of polymorphisms in dopaminergic genes does not suggest a distinct psychobiological profile for OCD patients with symmetry obsessions and related compulsions. Further work is needed to determine whether there are other (e.g. serotonergic) psychobiological mechanisms which may be responsible for symmetry concerns in OCD. Notably, our findings confirm that symmetry-related symptomatology in OCD may be associated with worse prognosis.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,M6708,10.1037/a0035164,Multiple risk-behavior profiles of smokers with serious mental illness and motivation for change,"Objective: Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) are dying on average 25 years prematurely. The leading causes are chronic preventable diseases. In the context of a tobacco-treatment trial, this exploratory study examined the behavioral risk profiles of adults with SMI to identify broader interventional needs. Method: Recruited from five acute inpatient psychiatry units, participants were 693 adult smokers (recruitment rate - 76%, 50% male, 45% Caucasian, age M = 39, 49% had income < $10,000) diagnosed with mood disorders (71%), substance-use disorders (63%), posttraumatic stress disorder (39%), psychotic disorders (25%), and attention deficit- hyperactivity disorder (25%). The Staging Health Risk Assessment, the primary measure used in this study, screened for risk status and readiness to change 11 health behaviors, referencing the period prior to acute hospitalization. Results: Participants averaged 5.2 (SD = 2.1) risk behaviors, including smoking (100%), high-fat diet (68%), inadequate fruits/vegetables (67%), poor sleep (53%), physical inactivity (52%), and marijuana use (46%). The percent prepared to change ranged from 23% for tobacco and marijuana to 76% for depression management. Latent class analysis differentiated three risk groups: the global higher risk group included patients elevated on all risk behaviors; the global lower risk group was low on all risks; and a mood and metabolic risk group, characterized by inactivity, unhealthy diet, sleep problems, and poor stress and depression management. The global higher risk group (11% of sample) was younger, largely male, and had the greatest number of risk behaviors and mental health diagnoses; had the most severe psychopathologies, addiction-treatment histories, and nicotine dependence; and the lowest confidence for quitting smoking and commitment to abstinence. Conclusion: Most smokers with SMI engaged in multiple risks. Expanding targets to treat co-occurring risks and personalizing treatment to individuals' multibehavioral profiles may increase intervention relevance, interest, and impact on health.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,M6604,10.1017/S1461145714000741,Update on the use of alpha-1 adrenoreceptor antagonists for PTSD,"Objective: Increased CNS noradrenergic activity contributes to the pathophysiology of PTSD, possibly by increased postsynaptic adrenoreceptor (AR) responsiveness to norepinephrine. Prazosin, a CNS active alpha-1 AR antagonist, has been demonstrated effective for treatment refractory trauma nightmares and sleep disruption in several placebo controlled trials. Here we evaluated prazosin in active duty US combat soldiers with PTSD and frequent trauma nightmares. The authors conducted a 15-week randomized controlled trial of the alpha-1 adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin for combat trauma nightmares, sleep quality, global function, and overall symptoms in active-duty soldiers with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) returned from combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Methods: Sixty-seven soldiers were randomly assigned to prazosin or placebo for 15 weeks. Drug was titrated based on nightmare response over 6 weeks to a possible maximum dose of 5 mg midmorning and 20 mg at bedtime for men and 2 mg midmorning and 10 mg at bedtime for women. Mean achieved bedtime doses were 15.6 mg of prazosin (SD=6.0) and 18.8 mg of placebo (SD =3.3) for men and 7.0 mg of prazosin (SD=3.5) and 10.0 mg of placebo (SD= 0.0) for women. Mean achieved midmorning doses were 4.0 mg of prazosin (SD=1.4) and 4.8 mg of placebo (SD=0.8) for men and 1.7 mg of prazosin (SD =0.5) and 2.0 mg of placebo (SD=0.0) mg for women. Primary outcome measures were the nightmare item of the CAPS, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the CGIC. Maintenance psychotropic medications and supportive psychotherapy were held constant. Results: Prazosin was effective for trauma nightmares, sleep quality, global function, total CAPS score and hyperarousal cluster. Prazosin was well tolerated. Conclusion: Prazosin is effective for combat-related PTSD with trauma nightmares in active-duty soldiers, and benefits are clinically meaningful.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,M11025,10.1016/S2221-6189(14)60066-4,Different profiles of mental and physical health and stress hormone response in women victims of intimate partner violence,"Objectives To analyse the individual differences in the impact that intimate male partner violence (IPV) has on a woman's depressive and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology, and to determine the association of the different profiles of mental dysfunction with cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) basal saliva levels as well as physical health symptoms. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out in which IPV victims (n=73) and control non-abused (n=31) women participated. Information was obtained through structured interviews and saliva samples were collected for hormonal assays under baseline conditions. Results There were three profiles of mental symptoms in IPV subjects: no symptoms (n=19); with depressive symptoms (n=36), and depressive/PTSD symptom (n=18). None of the non-abused women had depressive or PTSD symptoms. The stress hormone response differed between groups. Only the IPV-depressive group had higher evening cortisol, and both morning and evening DHEA, but lower morning cortisol/DHEA ratio than non-abused women. Furthermore, there were differences between the IPV groups. The IPV-depressive group had lower morning cortisol and morning cortisol/DHEA ratio than the IPV-no symptoms and lower morning cortisol/DHEA ratio than the IPV-depressive/PTSD group. With respect to the physical symptoms there was an association between the mean of symptoms and the profile of mental health, the incidence being higher in the depressive/PTSD group than in the other groups. Conclusions This study demonstrates that there are individual differences in the impact that IPV has on the stress response and health status in women victims.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,M9073,10.1002/jclp.22100,Elucidating posttraumatic stress symptom profiles and their correlates among women experiencing bidirectional intimate partner violence,"OBJECTIVE: This study employed latent class analysis to identify profiles of women experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) based on the severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. METHOD: Self-report data from a sample of 369 women experiencing bidirectional IPV was used. RESULTS: A 3-class solution comprising low, moderate, and high PTSD severity profiles best fit the data. Profiles were differentially related to whether IPV victimization was considered traumatic (PTSD criterion A); whether functioning was impaired as a result of PTSD symptoms (PTSD criterion F); whether the woman met full diagnostic criteria for PTSD; depression symptom severity; and severity of psychological, physical, and sexual IPV victimization and use of IPV. An extremely high percentage of women in the high (96%) and moderate (88%) severity classes experienced functional impairment, although many did not meet full diagnostic criteria for PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the need for interventions individually tailored to one's treatment needs based on the nature of one's traumatic stressor and the impact of PTSD on daily functioning.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,M9199,10.1016/j.eurpsy.2014.05.002,The role of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in risk for posttraumatic stress disorder: taking a nutritional approach toward universal prevention,"Several cross-sectional studies, but no prospective studies, have reported an association between an abnormal lipid profile and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We hypothesized that an abnormal lipid profile might predict risk for developing PTSD. In this prospective study, we analyzed data from 237 antidepressant-naïve severely injured patients who participated in the Tachikawa Cohort of Motor Vehicle Accident Study. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels at baseline were significantly lower in patients with PTSD than those without PTSD at 6 months after motor vehicle accident (MVA) and were inversely associated with risk for PTSD. In contrast, triglycerides (TG) at baseline were significantly higher in patients with PTSD than in those without PTSD at 6 months post-MVA and were positively associated with risk for PTSD. There was no clear association between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or total cholesterol and risk for PTSD. In conclusion, low HDL-C and high TG may be risk factors for PTSD. Determining lipid profiles might help identify those at risk for PTSD after experiencing trauma.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,M9221,10.1177/17511437140151S107,A comparison of UK-Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome 14-Questions Inventory (PTSS-14) in ICU survivors done in-hospital and again at one month after ICU discharge,"Detection and intervention in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after ICU admission is important for patient's quality of recovery. Data from the UK suggest that there is a high incidence of PTSD in ICU survivors, and an early specialist referral is required for these patients. A simple 14-point questionnaire such as PTSS-14 (which could be administered by clinicians without specialist psychological training) could be used to screen for risk of PTSD in ICU survivors. Literature is sparse on looking at the temporal profile and evolution of PTSS scores in hospital after ICU discharge and at one month at which the diagnosis of PTSD can be made. After ethics committee approval 447 survivors of ICU were prospectively enrolled from the Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, over a period from March 2010 to August 2013. Data collected included demographics, previous psychiatric history and PTSS scores. While all subjects (n=447) completed the initial questionnaire, 337 patients completed the questionnaire at one month. Mean age of this cohort was 59±16 years (279 males and 168 females). In the ward after ICU discharge there was a significant increase in the PTSS-14 scores 31±15 (mean±SD), which reduced at one month to 28±14 (p value 0.0004, paired t test, CI 1.0 to 3.5 ). There was correlation between the in-hospital and one-month PTSS-14 scores in patients (slope 0.572, R2 0.388) (Figure 1, following page). The scores correlated better in patients without a previous psychiatric history (R2 0.42 vs 0.21) and patients with an ICU length of stay (LOS) of less than five days (R2 0.49 vs 0.338). The strength of association (R2 value) declined further with increased ICU LOS. Gender and age did not influence the predictive value (males R2 0.395, females R2 0.369, <70 years R2 0.4, ≥70 years 0.4). (Table Presented) PTSS 14 can be used to screen for PTSD in ICU survivors early after ICU discharge. There is a temporal correlation between the in-hospital and the one-month PTSS scores in ICU survivors. Caution is advised in interpreting the results of patients with a previous psychiatric history and patients with an ICU LOS of five or more days. This could have a significant effect on the fraction of ICU survivors that could effectively be screened and followed up for risk of PTSD.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study aims to: firstly, identify the typology of women who delivered prematurely based on anxiety, depressive and PTSD symptoms; and secondly, examine whether these profiles differ on maternal perception of infant temperament, mother-infant bond and maternal involvement in infant care during the hospitalization process. Participants and method: Within four weeks of a preterm infant's hospital discharge, 110 French mothers (mean age SD] =29.5 4.3] years) completed questionnaires assessing PTSD symptoms, depressive and anxiety symptoms, maternal involvement in infant care, maternal perception of infant temperament and mother-infant bound. Results: Three profiles were highlighted: a first one labeled ""resilient group"" (n = 41, 37% of the sample), a second one labeled ""depressive group"" (n = 23, 21 % of the sample), and a third one labeled ""depressive-anxious-traumatized group"" (n = 46, 42% of the sample). Our findings also highlight a negative impact of postpartum depressive symptoms on mother-infant bond. Discussion: Within four weeks of infant's hospital discharge, only a third of mothers exhibited a resilient profile, while depressive symptom severity seems to have a negative impact on mother-infant bond. Further research focusing on the impact of postpartum depression using direct observation and developing is warranted.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,M6983,10.1186/s12888-014-0330-8,Comparison of psychiatric disability on the health of nation outcome scales (HoNOS) in resettled traumatized refugee outpatients and Danish inpatients,"Background: Currently, the mental health issues of traumatized refugees are mainly documented in terms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety. Importantly, there are no reports of the level of psychiatric disability in treatment seeking traumatized refugees resettled in the West. Insufficient acknowledgment of the collective load of bio-psycho-social problems in this patient group hinders effective psychiatric and social service utilization outside the specialized clinics for traumatized refugees. Methods: The level of psychiatric disability in traumatized refugees from Danish specialized clinics (N = 448) is documented using routine monitoring data from pre- and post-treatment on the Health of Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS). Furthermore, the HoNOS ratings are compared with routine monitoring data from Danish inpatients with different diagnoses (N = 10.911). Results: The routinely collected data indicated that despite their outpatient status, traumatized refugees had higher levels of psychiatric disability at pre-treatment compared to most inpatients. Moreover, the traumatized refugees had a HoNOS profile characterized by an overall high problem level in various psychiatric and social domains. The rate of pre- to post-treatment improvement on the HoNOS was smaller for the traumatized refugees than it was for the psychiatric inpatients. Conclusions: The level, and the versatile profile, of psychiatric disability on the HoNOS point to complex bio-psycho-social problems in resettled treatment seeking traumatized refugees. Thus, a broader assessment of symptoms and better cooperation between psychiatric, health care, and social systems is necessary in order to meet the treatment needs of this group.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,M10621,10.1111/jcpp.12213,Double disadvantage: the influence of childhood maltreatment and community violence exposure on adolescent mental health,"BACKGROUND: Childhood maltreatment is a key risk factor for maladjustment and psychopathology. Although maltreated youth are more likely to experience community violence, both forms of adversity are generally examined separately. Consequently, little is known about the unique and interactive effects that characterize maltreatment and community violence exposure (CVE) on mental health. METHODS: Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) was applied to data from a community sample of high-risk adolescents and young adults (n = 204, M = 18.85) to categorize groups of participants with similar patterns of childhood (i.e. past) maltreatment exposure. Associations between childhood maltreatment, CVE and mental health outcomes were then explored using multivariate regression and moderation analyses. RESULTS: Latent Profile Analysis identified three groups of individuals with low, moderate and severe levels of childhood maltreatment. Maltreatment was associated with more internalizing, externalizing, and trauma-related symptoms. By contrast, CVE showed independent associations with only externalizing and trauma-related symptoms. Typically, childhood maltreatment and CVE exerted additive effects; however, these forms of adversity interacted to predict levels of anger. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to maltreatment and community violence is associated with increased levels of clinical symptoms. However, while maltreatment is associated with increased symptoms across a broad range of mental health domains, the impact of community violence is more constrained, suggesting that these environmental risk factors differentially impact mental health functioning.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,M8570,10.1038/ajg.2014.279,Cmv proctitis in an immunocompetent young adult,"Introduction: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) proctitis may present in otherwise young, healthy, and immunocompetent individuals. CMV proctitis/colitis may mimic ischemic colitis and Clostridium difficile infection. A high index of suspicion must be maintained when evaluating such patients Case Report: An 18-year-old male presented to the emergency room with a 3-day history of abdominal pain and bright red blood per rectum. The patient reported multiple episodes of bright red blood per rectum and had never experienced similar symptoms in the past. His past medical history is significant for post-traumatic stress disorder and intermittent migraines. Patient attests to regular alcohol consumption, frequent marijuana use, and intermittent tobacco use. He is a heterosexual and is sexually active. There is no significant family history of inflammatory bowel disease, polyps, or colon cancer. Patient's vital signs were stable at the time of admission. His abdomen was soft and diffusely tender to palpation with no guarding or rigidity and his rectal exam was positive for bright red blood. His complete blood count showed a hemoglobin of 15.8, hematocrit of 44.4, WBC of 4, and platelets of 105. His chemistries, coagulation profile, and liver function tests were all within normal limits. He was HIV negative. The computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen demonstrated wall thickening and inflammatory changes of the rectum and distal sigmoid colon. Sigmoidoscopy revealed congested ulcerative mucosa in the rectum. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed erythematous mucosa in the gastric antrum. Pathology from the rectum demonstrated CMV proctitis that was confirmed by immunohistochemical stains. The patient was subsequently started on a 14-day course of valganciclovir. Discussion: Our patient, who was an otherwise healthy, immunocompetent male, presented with bright red blood per rectum secondary to CMV proctitis. In the era of HIV and immunosuppression, CMV has emerged as a well-known pathogen in those patients who are immunocompromised. The widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has seen a recent decline in the incidence of opportunistic CMV infection. CMV proctitis is an infrequently reported disease entity in patients with an intact immune system. Various risk factors for development in the immunocompetent host include mucosal injury by a disease process such as inflammatory bowel disease or aging. Thus, our patient, with no significant past medical history and an intact immune system, had a unique presentation of an uncommon disease process.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,M9972,,An atypical self-mutilation: Skin-burn with a lighter,"Non-suicidal self injury (NSSI) or self mutilation is deliberate self harming behavior to body tissue for the purpose of emotional relieving, punishment, getting attention or escaping a compelling situation. Estimated NSSI prevalence is %4 of general population whereas the rate is higher in adolescents and among individuals with psychiatric history as well as alcohol/substance abuse. Psychiatric comorbidities are common among individuals who are prone to self-harm. Bipolarity, personality disorders, particularly borderline and antisocial personality disorder are the risk factors for NSSI. There are different methods of NSSI including cutting, biting, hitting and skin picking or burning. Cutting is considered to be the most encountered form of self-mutilation in clinical practice. In this case report, we present a 21-year-old male with the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder, who burnt some parts of his body by using a lighter for self mutilation. Our patient was referred to outpatient clinic with restlessness, sleeplessness, racing and reference thoughts, and increased psychomotor activity. In his history, he had the diagnosis of Cluster B Personality Disorder before his last referral and had no current medication. In clinical evaluation, in addition to his mood disorder symptoms, conduct problems and substance use have been investigated due to his self-mutilation and substance abuse history. He reported no recent and current substance use while in his examination some red areas were seen on his forearms, neck and pectoral region. He reported that he had burnt his skin via a lighter to relieve his anxiety but he couldn't have remembered how and when he had made these lesions. His prior form of self-mutilations was cutting his skin whereas he had no burning type of self-harm before. He had no current suicidal thought and no suicidal attempt before. After clinical assessment, risperidone 2 mg/day and valproate sodium 1000 mg/day were administered as medication. Self-mutilation is increasingly becoming a more remarkable clinical condition in psychiatric practice. Whereas it was described as criteria of borderline personality disorder in DSM-IV TR, there is a tendency to consider it as distinct clinical entity. Several forms of self- harm have been reported in literature such as genital self-injury. Self-mutilation is not only a clinical symptom of personality disorders but also associated with mood disorders such as depression or bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders such as PTSD, OCD and a range of psychotic spectrum disorders. As self mutilation may be seen as in uncommon form like burning, clinicians should be aware of its probability in assessing individuals, particularly those with the diagnosis of mood disorders and personality disorders and evaluation should include all forms of self injury, rather than common forms such as cutting and hitting, only.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,M9857,,[First stage in identifying traumatic profil inpatients hospitalised in psychiatry in Martinique],"The population hospitalised in psychiatry seems more exposed to traumatic events than the French general population, with particularly more sexual aggressions. The aim of this study is to describe the population hospitalised in psychiatry and more precisely the traumatic history of these patients, their comorbidities (mental diseases and addictions), and socio economical level. This descriptive, cross sectional and retrospective study took place in the Crisis Center in the University Hospital in Martinique (French West Indies), from February to July 2013. A socio-demographic information, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5.0, the Trauma History Questionnaire and the Impact Events Scale-Revised were realised with 49 of the 143 patients admitted during this period (34.3%). In this population, we found a mean of 6.5 (standart-deviation=4.2) different types of traumatic event, with 38.8% patients reporting a natural disaster, and 38.8% declaring at least one sexual aggression. In the 25 patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, 66.7% underwent a sexual aggression, significatively during childhood (before 10 years old, P=0.01), and during adolescence (between 10 to 18 years old, P=0.01). These results underline the importance of a systematic screening of the traumatic profile: the characteristics of the traumatic events and its clinical impact.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,M5131,,Alpha1-adrenergic receptor antagonists use in treatment and prevention of psychiatric disorders: A review,"Therapeutic benefits of alpha1-adrenergic antagonists (A1As), namely, prazosin, terazosin and doxazosin, have begun to emerge in a broad range of psychiatric disorders in clinical trials. A1As have shown promise in the treatment of several psychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol dependence, cocaine dependence, nicotine cessation and dementia-related agitation in both animal and human studies. These, and other chronic psychiatric conditions, may be mediated or precipitated by stressful conditions. A1As beneficial effects in these psychiatric disorders are hypothesized via their unique effects on regulating norepinephrine (NE) and corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF), which are two key mediators of stress in the central nervous system (CNS). Despite increasing use of A1As in psychiatric disorders, there is a lack of comprehensive review. Animal studies have suggested that by regulating NE in stressful conditions, A1As can increase the pre-frontal cortical functioning and decrease amygdalar activity. Similarly, rat studies have shown a direct decrease in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) expression of CRF in rats treated with prazosin in stressful conditions. Thus, A1As may have potential benefit in the treatment and secondary prevention of stress-mediated or precipitated psychiatric disorders. In addition, another beneficial effect of A1As is known to be on improvement of metabolic parameters such as lipid profile and insulin sensitivity.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,M10032,,Partial least squares based gene expression analysis in posttraumatic stress disorder,"OBJECTIVE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an adverse psychological response to traumatic events. Microarray technology for large-scale gene expression analysis facilitates the identification of signatures that underlie the pathogenesis of PTSD. Previous studies mostly used variance/regression analysis without considering array specific factors. We aim to investigate the underlying mechanism of PTSD through partial least squares (PLS) based analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With a gene expression profile data set for 17 chronic PTSD patients and 16 controls recovered from psychological trauma from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we performed Partial Least Square (PLS) based analysis. RESULTS: We acquired 230 down-regulated genes and 335 up-regulated genes. Significantly increased representations of dysregulated genes in immune, endocrine and nervous pathways were identified. Among the top 5 hub genes in the network, PRKCA has been reported to be related with PTSD before. Three other genes,TP53, EP300 and CALM1 might also contribute to the pathogenesis of PTSD since they are all related with other neuronal disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed light on expression signatures of PTSD with the hope to give further theoretical supports for future therapeutic study.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,M7820,10.4088/JCP.13m08910,Postdeployment suicidal ideations and trajectories of posttraumatic stress disorder in danish soldiers: A 3-year follow-up of the USPER study,"Objective: Suicidal ideation in veterans is of great concern. The objective of this study is to examine how heterogeneous posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) trajectories are associated with postdeployment suicidal ideation in veterans 2.5 years postdeployment to a combat zone in Afghanistan. If PTSD trajectories are associated with postdeployment suicidal ideations, then the accumulative knowledge on what characterizes veterans falling into different PTSD trajectories may provide better opportunities for early identification of suicidal high-risk veterans. Method: In this prospective study of 743 Danish soldiers deployed to Afghanistan from February to August in 2009, we collected data at 6 time points from 6 weeks before deployment to 2.5 years after homecoming (total for this study: 456). At all assessments, the soldiers responded to a comprehensive questionnaire including measures of PTSD (measured by the PTSD Checklist, Civilian Version) and other mental and physical health variables, demographics, and social and combat-related factors. Suicidal ideation was measured by an item from the European Parasuicide Study Interview Schedule II. In a previous study based on soldiers from this cohort, we identified 6 PTSD trajectories using latent growth mixture modeling, which we have extracted and applied as independent variables in this study. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied to examine whether deployed soldiers with certain PTSD symptom trajectories were more likely to report suicidal ideation 2.5 years after homecoming. Results: Two PTSD trajectories with high PTSD symptom level 2.5 years after return were significantly associated with suicidal ideation 2.5 years after homecoming. Thus, a relieved-worsening class, described by initial decreasing PTSD symptom levels followed by a steep increase in symptoms had higher risk of suicidal ideation (OR = 7.84; 95% CI, 1.68-36.6), which was also the case for a late-onset class (OR 5.2; 95% CI, 2.21-12.24) when compared to a low-stable class. Conclusions: Heterogeneous PTSD trajectories are associated with suicidal ideation in veterans 2.5 years after homecoming.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also includes a profile of the work of Prof. Jan Piltz, the then director of the Clinic, and his major scientific achievements. The publications cited in the article date in the main from the period of World War I, and comprise clinical analyses of the consequences of stress suffered at the front as well as a description of the ways in which they were treated. These are presented alongside other major findings related to war neuroses being made in Europe at the time. The article draws attention to the very modern thinking on treatment of war neuroses, far ahead of the average standards of the day, evinced by Prof. Piltz and his team. The most important innovative elements of their treatment of these conditions were the fact that they perceived the cause of the neurosis to lie in previous personality disorders in the patients, their recommendation of psychotherapy as the main method of treatment, and their emphasis on the need for further rehabilitation following the completion of the course of hospital treatment. They also paid significant attention to the importance of drawing up individual therapy plans for each patient.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to analyse the psychiatric sequelae of TBI, and to identify the neuropsychological and psychopathological correlates of post-TBI MDD in order to highlight their differences from those of primary MDD. Methods: This was a longitudinal, prospective, case-control study. Sixteen patients with closed brain injury, and a lesion revealed by computed tomography (CT), were recruited and were evaluated one (T1), three (T3) and six (T6) months after discharge from Neurosurgery Department; the controls were six patients with MDD. The psychiatric symptoms were evaluated using brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), Hamilton depression rating scale (HRSD), Beck depression inventory scale (BDI), Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HRSA), global assessment of functioning (GAF) and instrumental activity of daily living (IADL). Neuropsychological profiles were assessed by using neuropsychological tests, focused on memory and frontal-executive functioning. Results: At T1, MDD was observed in 10 cases (62.5%), a manic episode in 12.5%, and post-traumatic stress disorder in 6.5%. At T3 and T6, MDD was diagnosed in, respectively, eight (50%) and six cases (37.5%). Post TBI MDD had less severe depressive symptoms, showed greater social isolation and hostility and more cognitive deficits in comparison with the control group. Conclusions: MDD is a frequent TBI complication. Patients with post-TBI MDD have a specific psychopathological profile characterised by a less severe depressive symptomatology and a neuropsychological pattern that is significantly associated with greater deficits in cognitive functions than those with primary MDD.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,M7632,10.1016/j.janxdis.2013.09.004,Diagnostic accuracy of three scoring methods for the Davidson Trauma Scale among U.S. military Veterans,"Self-report questionnaires are frequently used to identify PTSD among U.S. military personnel and Veterans. Two common scoring methods used to classify PTSD include: (1) a cut score threshold and (2) endorsement of PTSD symptoms meeting DSM-IV-TR symptom cluster criteria (SCM). A third method requiring a cut score in addition to SCM has been proposed, but has received little study. The current study examined the diagnostic accuracy of three scoring methods for the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) among 804 Afghanistan and Iraq war-era military Service Members and Veterans. Data were weighted to approximate the prevalence of PTSD and other Axis I disorders in VA primary care. As expected, adding a cut score criterion to SCM improved specificity and positive predictive power. However, a cut score of 68-72 provided optimal diagnostic accuracy. The utility of the DTS, the role of baseline prevalence, and recommendations for future research are discussed. © 2013.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,M7484,10.1186/s40359-014-0027-2,Student-teacher relationship trajectories and mental health problems in young children,"BACKGROUND: This longitudinal study classified groups of children experiencing different trajectories of student-teacher relationship quality over the transition from preschool into school, and determined the strength of the association between different student-teacher relationship trajectories and childhood mental health problems in the second year of primary school. METHODS: A community sample of 460 Australian children were assessed in preschool (age 4), the first school year (age 5), and second school year (age 6). Teachers at all three assessments reported on student-teacher relationship quality with the Student Teacher Relationship Scale. When the children were at preschool and in their second school year, parents and teachers rated children's mental health problems using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. RESULTS: Latent-class growth modelling identified two trajectories of student-teacher relationship quality: (1) a stable-high student-teacher relationship quality and (2) a moderate/declining student-teacher relationship quality trajectory. Generalised linear models found that after adjusting for family demographic characteristics, having a stable high quality student-teacher relationship trajectory was associated with fewer parent-rated and teacher-rated total mental health problems, and fewer conduct, hyperactivity, and peer problems, and greater prosocial behaviour at age 6. A stable high quality trajectory was also associated with fewer teacher-rated, but not parent-rated emotional symptoms. These effects remained after adjustment for levels of mental health problems at age 4. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that early intervention and prevention strategies that focus on building stable high quality student-teacher relationships during preschool and children's transition into formal schooling, may help reduce rates of childhood mental health problems during the early school years.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,M7429,,Thirty years of using a series of personality questionnaires constructed by computer,"Background: The series of personality questionnaires constructed using a computer was created on the basis of cybernetic theories of personality, which presupposes the existence of six conative control systems: a system for the regulation of defense responses, a system for the regulation of attack responses, a system for controlling physiological functions, a system for coordination of regulatory functions, system for integration of regulatory functions and system for regulation of activity. Six personality questionnaires measure the intensity of the following pathological personality tendencies: 1. neurasthenia and anxiety, 2. aggressiveness and impulsiveness, 3. conversive neurotic disorders, 4. psychotic dissociation, 5. psychotic regression and 6. extroversionintroversion. Subjects and methods: The sample consisted of 4368 persons: 3496 subjects without a diagnosis, and 872 patients with a psychiatric diagnosis. Participants had to fill in the six personality questionnaire. Data were collected anonymously, during psychological treatment at the Neuropsychiatric Hospital ""Dr. Ivan Barbot"" in Popovača, at the Department of Occupational Medicine and Transport and the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Prevention at Dr. Andrija Štampar Institute of Public Health and for the purpose of selection of candidates for employment in the period from 1984 until today. Basic metric characteristics were determined for all scales. Factor structure of the scales was determined using principal component analysis; as canonical discriminant analysis, polar taxons analysis and canonical correlation analysis are special cases of factor analysis, results of factor analysis were used for further processing. Results: Results from earlier studies are replicated on much larger sample: metric characteristics of scales are very good, as in previous studies, similar structure of polar taxons was found and discrimination between healthy subjects ad those with psychiatric diagnoses was successful. Canonical correlation analysis showed interconnection of reactions on certain scales and extremely complex relationship between them which indirectly confirms the theoretical model on the basis of which the scales are formed. Conclusions: The usefulness of this scales is confirmed in clinical setting and in selection of candidates for employment.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive literature review was conducted using CINAHL, PubMed, Google Scholar, and hand searches using the search terms breast cancer, survivor, and long-term or late effects. STUDY SELECTION: Articles published in English from 2002 to 2012 that addressed the long-term or late effects of adults with breast cancer were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Findings are discussed categorically, including the most common late and long-term psychosocial effects from relevant studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: Topics relevant to survivors included challenges to psychosocial, emotional, and cognitive well-being; satisfaction with life; sexuality; body image; anxiety; fear of recurrence and post-traumatic stress disorder; depression; cognitive dysfunction challenges to physical well-being; adverse cardiovascular events; fatigue; lymphedema; musculoskeletal symptoms; accelerated bone loss and fractures; pain; skin changes due to radiation; disease recurrence; and new breast cancers. CONCLUSIONS: With earlier detection methods and improvements in treatment options making breast cancer a highly survivable disease, there are more survivors of breast cancer than ever. The clinicians' role in survivorship care is more important than ever to manage the potential long-term and late effects of treatment, physical and emotional well-being, and recurrent disease surveillance. However, the clinician's role in cancer follow-up care is often poorly defined leading to a lack of awareness about the needs of survivors of breast cancer, suboptimal communication between providers and survivors, and an overall deficiency in quality care.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,M8508,10.1038/npp.2014.280,Abnormal structure of fear circuitry in pediatric post-traumatic stress disorder,"Background: Structural brain studies of adult PTSD show reduced gray matter volume (GMV) in fear regulatory areas including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and hippocampus. Surprisingly, neither finding has been reported in pediatric PTSD. One possibility is that they represent delayed developmental effects that are not fully apparent until adulthood. Alternatively, lower resolution MRI and image processing techniques in prior studies may have limited detection of such differences. Here we examine fear circuitry GMV, including age-related differences, using higher resolution MRI in pediatric PTSD vs. healthy youth. Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, 3T anatomical brain MRI was acquired in 27 medication-free youth with PTSD and 27 healthy non-traumatized youth of comparable age, sex, and IQ. Images were processed in SPM8 using linear and nonlinear (DARTEL) transformations with output images corrected for total GMV. Voxel-based morphometry was used to compare GMV in a priori regions including the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala/ hippocampus, with family-wise error correction. Primary analyses examined group and group X age differences, as well as PTSD symptom cluster relationships to GMV within the PTSD group. Results: PTSD youth had reduced GMV but no age-related differences in anterior vmPFC (BA 10/11, Z=4.5), which inversely correlated with PTSD duration. In contrast, while there was no overall group difference in hippocampal volume, a group X age interaction (Z=3.6) was present in the right anterior hippocampus. Here, age positively predicted hippocampal volume in healthy youth but negatively predicted volume in PTSD youth. Within the PTSD group, re-experiencing symptoms inversely correlated with subgenual cingulate (sgACC, Z=3.7) and right anterior hippocampus (Z=3.5) GMV. Post-hoc analyses revealed that these findings were not associated with trauma exposure per se. Conclusions: Pediatric PTSD is associated with abnormal structure of the vmPFC and age-related differences in the hippocampus, regions important in the extinction and contextual gating of fear. Reduced anterior vmPFC volume may confer impaired recovery from illness, consistent with its role in the allocation of attentional resources. In contrast, individual differences in sgACC volume were associated with re-experiencing symptoms, consistent with the role of the sgACC in fear extinction. The negative relationship between age and hippocampal volume in youth with PTSD suggests an ongoing neurotoxic process over development, which further contributes to illness expression. Future studies employing a longitudinal design would be merited to further explore these possibilities.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,M5271,10.1002/ab.21554,Personality assessment inventory internalizing and externalizing structure in veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder: associations with aggression,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with aggressive behavior in veterans, and difficulty controlling aggressive urges has been identified as a primary postdeployment readjustment concern. Yet only a fraction of veterans with PTSD commit violent acts. The goals of this study were to (1) examine the higher-order factor structure of Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) scales in a sample of U.S. military veterans seeking treatment for PTSD; and (2) to evaluate the incremental validity of higher-order latent factors of the PAI over PTSD symptom severity in modeling aggression. The study sample included male U.S. Vietnam (n = 433) and Iraq/Afghanistan (n = 165) veterans who were seeking treatment for PTSD at an outpatient Veterans Affairs (VA) clinic. Measures included the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, the PAI, and the Conflict Tactics Scale. The sample was randomly split into two equal subsamples (n's = 299) to allow for cross-validation of statistically derived factors. Parallel analysis, variable clustering analysis, and confirmatory factor analyses were used to evaluate the factor structure, and regression was used to examine the association of factor scores with self-reports of aggression over the past year. Three factors were identified: internalizing, externalizing, and substance abuse. Externalizing explained unique variance in aggression beyond PTSD symptom severity and demographic factors, while internalizing and substance abuse did not. Service era was unrelated to reports of aggression. The constructs of internalizing versus externalizing dimensions of PTSD may have utility in identifying characteristics of combat veterans in the greatest need of treatment to help manage aggressive urges.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among police registrants at Survey Wave 2, 5-6 years after 9/11/01, four unique trajectories of probable PTSD symptoms were identified: resilient (83%), recovered (2.5%), delayed onset (11.2%) and chronic (5.3%). The current study documents the longitudinal trajectories of PTSD in police officers exposed to the WTC attacks at Wave 3 (2011-2012), over 10 years since the WTC attack. Method We examined the prevalence of probable PTSD at the Wave 3 survey using a cut-off score of 44 or greater on the event-specific Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL) and at least one re-experiencing symptom (DSM-IV criterion B), three avoidance or numbing symptoms (DSM-IV criterion C), and two hyperarousal symptoms (DSM-IV criterion D). Results Probable PTSD was 14.4% (95% CI 13.0-15.9%) at Wave 2 and 12.9% (95% CI, 11.6-14.3%) at Wave 3. Significant predictors of chronic probable PTSD 10 years post-disaster (n = 59/2241, 2.6%) include age 45-69 (aOR 3.16, 95% CI, 1.7-6.0), number of stressful events witnessed on 9/11/01 (aOR 3.00, 1.6-5.8), five or more stressful life events since 9/11/01 (aOR 5.42, 1.9-15.2), and unmet mental health care needs (aOR 6.86, 3.3-14.1). Protective factors include social support (aOR 0.34, 0.1-0.97) and number of close friends or relatives (aOR 0.92, 0.87-0.98).

68,M8526,,A review of the current clinical use of quetiapine and extended release quetiapine in the management of anxiety and related disorders,"A comprehensive approach to the management of anxiety disorders continues to be a clinical challenge as current therapies have shown only limited efficacy. Quetiapine (available as an immediate-release and an extended-release XR] formulation) is an atypical antipsychotic agent with primary dopaminergic and serotonergic blocking activity, which has well-established records of clinical efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Recent controlled trials provide increasing evidence in support of the role of quetiapine XR as both monotherapy and as an augmentation therapy in the treatment of several anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and post- traumatic stress disorder. To date, there is only limited evidence for its use in panic disorder. Quetiapine XR is an important alternative especially for patients who had a partial remission of symptoms or who have not responded to first-line treatments for mood and anxiety disorders. It may also provide an important option in patients whose anxiety disorder is comorbid with an underlying bipolar mood disorder. Quetiapine’s safety and tolerability profile in the management of anxiety disorders is comparable to what is observed when quetiapine is used for other psychiatric conditions, however, it has yet to receive FDA approval for use in generalized anxiety disorder due to potential long-term metabolic adverse effects. Thus, given its efficacy and tolerability, it is important to consider the potential benefit of its ability to manage mood and anxiety disorder symptomatology, while closely monitoring for the more worrisome adverse events.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,M5320,10.1177/1077559514551945,Trajectories of depressive symptoms in foster youth transitioning into adulthood: the roles of emotion dysregulation and PTSD,"Foster youth often experience considerable adversity both in and out of foster care, including histories of abuse and/or neglect, and further stressors within the foster system. These adverse experiences often occur at key developmental periods that can compromise emotional functioning and lead to posttraumatic symptomatology, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and emotion dysregulation. In the face of difficult histories and ongoing mental health challenges, youth transitioning into adulthood may be particularly vulnerable to increases in depressive symptoms. We explored the trajectory of depressive symptoms in foster youth from age 17 to 19 using a piecewise linear growth model, examining the effects of PTSD and emotion dysregulation on youth's depressive symptoms over time. Results revealed depressive symptoms decreased from age 17 to 18 but increased from 18 to 19. PTSD and emotion dysregulation predicted greater baseline depressive symptoms and decreases in symptoms from age 17 to 18, whereas only PTSD predicted increases in depressive symptoms from 18 to 19. Females reported higher levels of depressive symptoms compared to males. Additionally, emotion dysregulation was a stronger predictor of depressive symptoms for females than males.

On a routine basis, we assessed health related quality of life two years after trauma of severely injured patients at our level-I trauma centre via posted survey. Patients and methods: The posted survey included (1) POLO-Chart questionnaire with European Quality of Life (EuroQoL), Short Form Health Survey-36 (SF 36) and the recently developed and validated Trauma Outcome Profile (TOP) combined with (2) single centre data according to TraumaRegister DGU® data sets including trauma mechanism, injuries and initial treatment. Inclusion criteria were severely injured patients ≥18 years, treated between 2008 and 2010. Exclusion criteria were death, cognitive impairment, lack of German language and denial of participation. Results: 129 datasets were eligible for analysis reflecting a typical trauma collective with mean age 44 years, predominantly male (67%), mean ISS 22 and 98% blunt trauma. Two years after trauma, 62% of the patients reported of relevant remaining pain and 64% of severe functional deficit in at least one body region. Sixty-four percent of the patients suffered from decreased overall quality of life (EuroQoL ≤ 0.8). Additionally, all domains of SF-36 were impaired compared to an age and gender adjusted cohort of healthy individuals, especially domains of pain and activity of daily living. These impairments were associated with decreased 'social functioning' and 'emotional role functioning'. TOP results confirmed these findings: Quality of life was decreased in almost every dimension. TOP additionally identified sequels especially in domains of ""Mental Functioning"" and impairments in psychological recovery including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. Socioeconomic impairments were frequent including further hospitalisations (62%), duration of inability to work ≥6 month (54%), financial disadvantages (45%) and work loss (26%). Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that multiple trauma patients two years after injury suffer from impairments including persisting pain, functional deficits, mental and socioeconomic deficits. The 'Trauma Outcome Profile' instrument seems a proper tool to discover impairments in trauma patients early on and guide proper rehabilitation resources to the best of the patient.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, baclofens short duration of action and side effects limit its wider use. Here we characterized a novel, GABAB receptor positive allosteric modulator (PAM) ADX71943. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH In vitro, ADX71943 was assessed for pharmacological activity and selectivity using recombinant and native GABAB receptors. In vivo ADX71943 was assessed in the acetic acid-induced writhing (AAW) test in mice and formalin tests (FTs) in mice and rats. Marble burying (MB) and elevated plus maze (EPM) tests, rotarod, spontaneous locomotor activity (sLMA) and body temperature (BT) tests in mice and rats were used to investigate centrally-mediated effects. KEY RESULTS In vitro, in the presence of GABA, ADX71943 increased the potency and efficacy of agonists and showed selectivity at the ABAB receptor. ADX71943 reduced pain-associated behaviours in AAW; an effect blocked by GABAB receptor antagonist CGP63360. ADX71943 reduced pain in the FT in mice and rats, but was inactive in the MB and EPM despite reaching high concentrations in plasma. ADX71943 had no effect on BT, rotarod and sLMA. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS ADX71943 showed consistent and target-related efficacy in tests of disorders that have a significant peripheral component (acute and chronic pain), while having no effect in those associated with centrally-mediated anxiety-like reactivity and side effects.

The first was to identify groups of adolescents based on their similarity of responding across a number of victimizing and potentially traumatic events (PTEs). In doing so, we employed the statistical technique of Latent Class Analysis (LCA). The second aim was to assess the relationship between our resultant classes and the covariates of gender, suicide attempt, and PTSD. METHODS: Two hundred and sixty-nine Greenlandic school students, aged 12-18 (M = 15.4, SD = 1.84) were assessed for their level of exposure to PTEs. In addition, adolescents were assessed for the psychological impact of these events. A LCA was performed on seven binary indicators representing PTEs. Logistic regression was subsequently implemented to ascertain the relationships between latent classes and covariates. RESULTS: Three distinct classes were uncovered: a violence, neglect, and bullying class (class 1), a wide-ranging multiple PTE class (class 2), and a normative/baseline class (class 3). Notably, classes 1 and 2 were largely separated by the presence or absence of sexual PTEs. Individuals who reported having previously attempted suicide were almost six times more likely to be members of class 1 (OR = 5.97) and almost four times more likely to be members of class 2 (OR = 3.87) compared to the baseline class (class 3). Individuals who met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD were five times as likely to be members of class 1 and class 2 (OR = 5.09) compared to the baseline class. No significant associations were found between classes and gender. CONCLUSION: The results underline the complexity of the interplay between multiple victimization experiences, traumatization, and suicide attempts.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,M7265,10.1016/j.rehab.2014.08.010,Cognitive and behavioural post-traumatic impairments: What is the specificity of a brain injury ? A study within the ESPARR cohort,"The variety and extent of impairments occurring after traumatic brain injury vary according to the nature and severity of the lesions. In order to better understand their interactions and long-term outcome, we have studied and compared the cognitive and neurobehavioral profile one year post onset of patients with and without traumatic brain injury in a cohort of motor vehicle accident victims. Method: The study population is composed of 207 seriously injured persons from the ESPARR cohort. This cohort, which has been followed up in time, consists in 1168 motor vehicle accident victims (aged 16 years or more) with injuries with all degrees of severity. Inclusion criteria were: living in Rhone county, victim of a traffic accident having involved at least one wheel-conducted vehicle and having occurred in Rhone county, alive at the time of arrival in hospital and having presented in one of the different ER facilities of the county. The cohort's representativeness regarding social and geographic criteria and the specificities of the accidents were ensured by the specific targeting of recruitment. Deficits and impairments were assessed one year after the accident using the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale - Revised and the Trail-Making Test. Within our seriously injured group, based on the Glasgow Score, the presence of neurological deficits, aggravation of neurological condition in the first 72. hours and/or abnormal cerebral imaging, we identified three categories: (i) moderate/severe traumatic brain injury (n= 48), (ii) mild traumatic brain injury (n= 89), and (iii) severely injured but without traumatic brain injury (n= 70). Results: The most frequently observed symptoms were anxiety, irritability, memory and attention impairments, depressive mood and emotional lability. While depressive mood and irritability were observed with similar frequency in all three groups, memory and attention impairments, anxiety and reduced initiative were more specific to traumatic brain injury whereas executive disorders were associated with moderate/severe traumatic brain injury. Discussion-Conclusion: The presence and the initial severity of a traumatic brain injury condition the nature and frequency of residual effects after one year. Some impairments such as irritability, which is generally associated with traumatic brain injury, do not appear to be specific to this population, nor does depressive mood. Substantial interactions between cognitive, affective and neurobehavioral disorders have been highlighted.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,M9231,10.1016/j.jad.2014.06.055,PTSD prevalence and symptom structure of DSM-5 criteria in adolescents and young adults surviving the 2011 shooting in Norway,"BACKGROUND: Diagnostic criteria for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) have been revised for DSM-5. Two key changes include alteration of the clustering of PTSD symptoms and new PTSD symptom criteria related to negative alterations in cognition and mood. In this study, we empirically investigated these changes. METHODS: We interviewed 325 adolescents and young adults who survived the 2011 youth camp shooting at Utøya Island, Norway. The UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for DSM-IV was used to assess symptoms of PTSD. In addition, 11 questions were added to assess the four new symptom criteria within the new DSM-5 symptom categories. RESULTS: PTSD prevalence did not differ significantly whether DSM-IV (11.1%) or DSM-5 (11.7%) criteria were used and the Cohen׳s Kappa for consistency between the diagnoses was 0.061. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the four-factor structure of the DSM-5 fit the data adequately according to the conceptual model outlined. LIMITATIONS: The homogeneity of this sample of highly exposed subjects may preclude generalization to less severely exposed groups. Also, we did not assess criterion G in regard to symptoms causing clinically significant distress and functional impairment. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of PTSD was quite similar regardless of diagnostic system. The relatively low concordance between the diagnoses has implications for eligibility for a diagnosis of PTSD.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,M11435,10.4088/JCP.13m08914,Latent trajectories of trauma symptoms and resilience: The 3-year longitudinal prospective USPER study of Danish veterans deployed in Afghanistan,"Objective: To identify trajectories of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms from before to 2.5 years after deployment and to assess risk factors for symptom fluctuations and late-onset PTSD. Method: 743 soldiers deployed to Afghanistan in 2009 were assessed for PTSD symptoms using the PTSD Checklist (PCL) at 6 occasions from predeployment to 2.5 years postdeployment (study sample = 561). Predeployment vulnerabilities and deployment and postdeployment stressors were also assessed. Results: Six trajectories were identified: a resilient trajectory with low symptom levels across all assessments (78.1%) and 5 trajectories showing symptom fluctuations. These included a trajectory of late onset (5.7%), independently predicted by earlier emotional problems (OR = 5.59; 95% CI, 1.57- 19.89) and predeployment and postdeployment traumas (OR = 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04-1.17 and OR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.00-1.26). Two trajectories of symptom fluctuations in the low-to-moderate range (7.5% and 4.1%); a trajectory of symptom relief during deployment, but with a drastic increase at the final assessments (2.0%); and a trajectory with mild symptom increase during deployment followed by relief at return (2.7%) were also found. Symptom fluctuation was predicted independently by predeployment risk factors (depression OR = 1.27; 95% CI, 1.16-1.39], neuroticism OR = 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00-1.21], and earlier traumas OR = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.16]) and deployment-related stressors (danger/injury exposure OR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.04-1.40]), but not by postdeployment stressors. Discussion: The results confirm earlier findings of stress response heterogeneity following military deployment and highlight the impact of predeployment, perideployment, and postdeployment risk factors in predicting PTSD symptomatology and late-onset PTSD symptoms.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The QEEG LORETA data is reported as Z-scores of z = ± 2.54, p < 0.013. The focus is on demonstration of patterns of brain wave oscillations reflecting multiple brain functions in multiple ROIs in the presence of the tinnitus signal (SIT). The patterns of brain activity both high, middle and low frequencies are hypothesized to reflect connectivities within and between multiple neuronal networks in brain. The Loreta source localization non auditory ROI Images at the maximal abnormality in the very narrow band frequency spectra (24.21 Hz), showed the mathematically most probable underlying sources of the scalp recorded data to be greatest in the mid-cingulate, bilateral precuneus, cingulate and the bilateral caudate nucleus. Clinical correlation of the data with the history and course of the SIT is considered an objective demonstration of the affect, behavioral, and emotional component of the SIT. The correlation of the caudate activity, SIT as the traumatic event with the clinical course of PTSD, and the clinical diagnosis of PTSD is discussed. The clinical translation for patient care is highlighted in a SIT patient with multiple comorbidities by translation of QEEG/LORETA electrophysiologic data, as an adjunct to: provide an objectivity of patterns of brain wave activity in multiple regions of interest (ROIs) reflecting multiple brain functions, in response to and in the presence of the tinnitus signal, recorded from the scalp and analyzed with the metrics of absolute power, relative power, asymmetry, and coherence, for the subjective tinnitus complaint (SIT); 2) provide an increase in the accuracy of the tinnitus diagnosis; 3) assess/monitor treatment efficacy; 4) provide a rationale for selection of a combined tinnitus targeted therapy of behavioral, pharmacologic, sound therapy modalities of treatment attempting tinnitus relief; 5) provide insight into the medical significance of the SIT; 6) attempt discriminant function analysis for identification of a particular diagnostic clinical category of CNS neuropsychiatric disease; and 7) attempt to translate what is known of the neuroscience of sensation, brain function, QEEG/LORETA source localization, for the etiology and prognosis of the individual SIT patient.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,M5870,10.1556/JBA.3.2014.4.2,Compulsive sexual behavior among male military veterans: Prevalence and associated clinical factors,"Background and aims: Compulsive sexual behavior (CSB) is highly prevalent among men, often co-occurring with psychiatric disorders and traumatic experiences. Psychiatric disorders and trauma are highly prevalent among military veterans, yet there is a paucity of research on CSB among military samples. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of and factors associated with CSB among male military veterans. Methods: Surveys were administered to veterans of Operations Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom, or New Dawn at baseline (n = 258), 3 months (n = 194), and 6 months (n = 136). Bivariate analyses and Generalized Estimating Equations were utilized to estimate associations between CSB and the following variables: psychiatric co-morbidity, childhood physical or sexual trauma, pre- and post-deployment experiences, TV/ Internet usage, and sociodemographics. Associations between CSB and specific PTSD symptom clusters were also examined. Results: CSB was reported by 16.7% of the sample at baseline. Several variables were associated with CSB in bivariate analyses; however, only PTSD severity, childhood sexual trauma, and age remained significant in multivariable GEE models. The PTSD symptom cluster re-experiencing was most strongly associated with CSB. Discussion: This exploratory study suggests that CSB is prevalent amongst veterans returning from combat and is associated with childhood trauma and PTSD, particularly re-experiencing. Conclusions: Further study is needed to identify the mechanisms linking PTSD and CSB, define the context and severity of CSB in veterans, and examine the best ways to assess and treat CSB in VA clinical settings.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,M5987,10.1002/jts.21954,Associations between functioning and PTSD symptom clusters in a dismantling trial of cognitive processing therapy in female interpersonal violence survivors,"This study conducted secondary analyses of a published trial and sought to determine if different domains of psychosocial functioning (e.g., daily living, work, nonfamily relationships) improved following trauma-focused treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Cognitive processing therapy (CPT), an empirically supported treatment that involves evaluating trauma-related beliefs and written trauma accounts, was compared to its components: CPT without the written accounts or written accounts only in a sample of 78 women with PTSD secondary to interpersonal violence. Overall and individual domains of functioning significantly improved with treatment and results were similar across treatment groups, Fs (2, 150) ≥ 11.87, ps < .001. Additionally, we investigated whether changes in different PTSD symptom clusters were associated with outcomes in domains of psychosocial functioning, after collapsing across treatment condition. Multiple hierarchical linear regression analyses revealed that overall clinician-assessed PTSD symptom reduction was associated with outcomes in all domains of functioning, βs = .44 to .68, ps < .001. Additionally, improvements in the emotional numbing symptom cluster were associated with outcomes in the nonfamily relationships domain, β = .42, p < .001, and improvements in the hyperarousal symptom cluster were associated with outcomes in the overall, daily living, and household tasks domains, βs = .34 to .39, ps < .01. Results suggest that it may be important to monitor improvements in emotional numbing and hyperarousal symptoms throughout treatment to increase the likelihood of changes in psychosocial functioning.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,M11380,10.1007/s00127-014-0819-y,The co-occurrence of PTSD and dissociation: differentiating severe PTSD from dissociative-PTSD,"PURPOSE: A dissociative-posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) subtype has been included in the DSM-5. However, it is not yet clear whether certain socio-demographic characteristics or psychological/clinical constructs such as comorbid psychopathology differentiate between severe PTSD and dissociative-PTSD. The current study investigated the existence of a dissociative-PTSD subtype and explored whether a number of trauma and clinical covariates could differentiate between severe PTSD alone and dissociative-PTSD. METHODS: The current study utilized a sample of 432 treatment seeking Canadian military veterans. Participants were assessed with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and self-report measures of traumatic life events, depression, and anxiety. CAPS severity scores were created reflecting the sum of the frequency and intensity items from each of the 17 PTSD and 3 dissociation items. The CAPS severity scores were used as indicators in a latent profile analysis (LPA) to investigate the existence of a dissociative-PTSD subtype. Subsequently, several covariates were added to the model to explore differences between severe PTSD alone and dissociative-PTSD. RESULTS: The LPA identified five classes: one of which constituted a severe PTSD group (30.5 %), and one of which constituted a dissociative-PTSD group (13.7 %). None of the included, demographic, trauma, or clinical covariates were significantly predictive of membership in the dissociative-PTSD group compared to the severe PTSD group. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, a significant proportion of individuals report high levels of dissociation alongside their PTSD, which constitutes a dissociative-PTSD subtype. Further investigation is needed to identify which factors may increase or decrease the likelihood of membership in a dissociative-PTSD subtype group compared to a severe PTSD only group.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,M11465,10.1111/cts.12171,Genetic determinants of the endo-cannabinoid system and threat processing in humans,"OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS Patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are unable to suppress fear responses and negative appraisals from threat memories. Family and twin studies support that a genetic susceptibility regarding the processing of threatening events could increase the risk for PTSD. Research in rodents demonstrates that pharmacological enhancement of the endo-cannabinoid (eCB) system results in a faster extinction of threat memories. In humans, differences in eCB activity can result from genetic variations of the receptor gene (CNR1) and the enzyme that breaks down the eCB ligands (FAAH). Our objective is to correlate cognitive appraisals and physiological responses to threat with genetic determinants of the human eCB system. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION In adult, human subjects with PTSD and healthy controls, we will measure physiological (skin conductance) responses during a classical fear conditioning and extinction protocol. We will evaluate cognitive appraisal by measuring their reaction time to a threat versus neutral words appearing on a computer monitor during the cognitive conflict task. We will also gather a psychological profile with clinical anxiety questionnaires. For analysis, subjects will be grouped and compared according to their CNR1 & FAAH genotypes. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS We hypothesize that the eCB system is associated with threat processing in humans, and that healthy participants, depending on their genotype, have significantly different threat processing measures. We also hypothesize that PTSD patients compared to healthy humans, carry differences in allelic frequencies of the genotypes studied from the eCB system. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT Our long term goal is to determine pharmacogenetic markers of human responses to threats, to identify at risk individuals, and therapeutic targets that enhance treatments in favor of PTSD patients.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81,M5991,10.1007/s10865-013-9500-2,Treatment-related reductions in PTSD and changes in physical health symptoms in women,"This study examined the relationship between change in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms over the course of PTSD treatment and the association with changes in general physical health symptoms. Both positive health habits (e.g., exercise) and negative (e.g., smoking), were examined to determine if they accounted for the association between changes in PTSD severity over time and changes in physical health. Participants were 150 women seeking treatment for PTSD. Latent growth curve modeling indicated a substantial relationship (R (2) = 34%) between changes in PTSD and changes in physical health that occurred during and shortly following treatment for PTSD. However, there was no evidence to suggest that changes in health behaviors accounted for this relationship. Thus, PTSD treatment can have beneficial effects on self-reported physical health symptoms, even without direct treatment focus on health per se, and is not accounted for by shifts in health behavior.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,M6020,10.1037/a0037272,Different profiles of acute stress disorder differentially predict posttraumatic stress disorder in a large sample of female victims of sexual trauma,"This study aimed to test the dimensional structure of acute stress disorder (ASD). Latent profile analysis was conducted on scores from the Acute Stress Disorder Scale (Bryant, Moulds, & Guthrie, 2000) using a large sample of female victims of sexual trauma. Four distinct classes were found. Two of the classes represented high and low levels of ASD, and the high ASD class was associated with a high probability of subsequent posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There were 2 intermediate classes that were differentiated by the number of arousal symptoms, and the class with high levels of arousal symptoms had a higher risk of PTSD. The results suggested that ASD is best described by qualitatively and quantitatively differing subgroups in this sample, whereas previous research has assumed ASD to be dimensional. This may explain the limited success of using ASD to predict subsequent PTSD.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also examined three predictors of the course of stigma: post-traumatic stress disorder symptom severity, vertical and horizontal unit cohesion, and mental health treatment utilization while deployed. RESULTS: Perceptions of stigma remained largely stable across the deployment cycle, with latent growth curve analyses revealing a statistically significant but small decrease in stigma over time. Lower post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and greater perceived vertical and horizontal support predicted decreases in stigma over time, whereas mental health treatment utilization in theater did not predict the course of stigma. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived stigma was low and largely stable over time. OBJECTIVES: Prior research on mental health stigma in military personnel has been cross-sectional. We prospectively examined the course of perceived mental health stigma in a cohort of deployed U.S. combat Marines.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,M5721,10.1186/1129-2377-15-35,"Recurrent headache and interpersonal violence in adolescence: the roles of psychological distress, loneliness and family cohesion: the HUNT study","Background: Recurrent headache is the most common and disabling pain condition in adolescence. Co-occurrence of psychosocial adversity is associated with increased risk of chronification and functional impairment. Exposure to interpersonal violence seems to constitute an important etiological factor. Thus, knowledge of the multiple pathways linking interpersonal violence to recurrent headache could help guide preventive and clinical interventions. In the present study we explored a hypothetical causal model where the link between exposure to interpersonal violence and recurrent headache is mediated in parallel through loneliness and psychological distress. Higher level of family cohesion and male sex is hypothesized to buffer the adverse effect of exposure to interpersonal violence on headache. Methods: The model was assessed using data from the cross-sectional, population-based Young-HUNT 3 study of Norwegian adolescents, conducted from 2006–2008. A cohort of 10 464 adolescents were invited. The response rate was 73% (7620), age ranged from 12 and 20 years, and 50% (3832) were girls. The study comprised self-report measures of exposure to interpersonal violence, loneliness, psychological distress and family cohesion, in addition to a validated interview on headache, meeting the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria. Recurrent headache was defined as headache recurring at least monthly during the past year, and sub-classified into monthly and weekly headache, which served as separate outcomes. Results: In Conditional Process Analysis, loneliness and psychological distress consistently posed as parallel mediating mechanisms, indirectly linking exposure to interpersonal violence to recurrent headache. We found no substantial moderating effect of family cohesion or sex. Conclusions: Loneliness and psychological distress seem to play crucial roles in the relationship between exposure to interpersonal violence and recurrent headache. To facilitate coping and recovery, it may be helpful to account for these factors in preventive and clinical interventions. Trauma-informed, social relationship-based interventions may represent a major opportunity to alter trajectories of recurrent headache.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,M11545,,Changes about “trauma” and “stress” in DSM-5,"DSM-5, The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, was released at the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) meeting in May 2013 that is the fifth major revision. In DSM-5, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is no longer included in Anxiety Disorders and included in a new chapter as Trauma- and Stress-or-Related Disorders. The Trauma-and-Stressor Related Disorders include Reactive Attachment Disorder, Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder, Acute Stress Disorder, PTSD and Adjustment Disorders. Trauma- and Stress-or-Related Disorders reşect the close relationship between anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive and dissociative disorders. DSM-5 eliminates the distinction between acute and chronic phases of PTSD. The patient must have PTSD symptoms that persist for at least 1 month after the traumatic event. The DSM-5 aimed to expand the definition of PTSD beyond the fear construct. DSM-5 draws a clear line about the traumatic event. The definition of trauma in PTSD indicates “Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence.” Sexual assault is specifically included. PTSD patients can be the actual victim or witness. Exposure to the trauma through electronic media, television, movies, and pictures is not considered as PTSD unless these traumatic events are work-related. There are four PTSD symptom clusters (There were three in DSM IV) a) Intrusion symptoms including dissociative reactions (dissociative reactions are şashbacks, derealization, and depersonalization.) b) avoidance symptoms c) Negative alterations in mood and cognitions (dysphoric type) d) alterations in arousal and reactivity. To satisfy the criteria for PTSD, there must be a minimum number of symptoms from each cluster: at least one of five re-experiencing symptoms, one of two avoidance symptoms, three of seven cognitions and mood symptoms, and three of six hyperarousal symptoms. The number of symptoms increased from 17 in DSM-IV to 20 in DSM-5. There are new symptoms, namely persistent negative beliefs and expectations about oneself or the world, persistent negative trauma-related emotions, and risky or reckless behaviors. Diagnostic criteria have been suitable for children and adolescents. Separate criteria have been added for children aged 6 years or younger. Thus, there is not a separate child section in DSM-5.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,M6033,10.1002/jts.21962,Prior exposure to interpersonal violence and long-term treatment response for boys with a disruptive behavior disorder,"Interpersonal violence (IPV) is common in children with a disruptive behavior disorder (DBD) and increases the risk for greater DBD symptom severity, callous-unemotional (CU) traits, and neuroendocrine disruption. Thus, IPV may make it difficult to change symptom trajectories for families receiving DBD interventions given these relationships. The current study examined whether IPV prior to receiving treatment for a DBD predicted trajectories of a variety of associated outcomes, specifically DBD symptoms, CU traits, and cortisol concentrations. Boys with a DBD diagnosis (N = 66; age range = 6-11 years; 54.5% of whom experienced IPV prior to treatment) of either oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder participated in a randomized clinical trial and were assessed 3 years following treatment. Multilevel modeling demonstrated that prior IPV predicted smaller rates of change in DBD symptoms, CU traits, and cortisol trajectories, indicating less benefit from intervention. The effect size magnitudes of IPV were large for each outcome (d = 0.88-1.07). These results suggest that IPV is a predictor of the long-term treatment response for boys with a DBD. Including trauma-focused components into existing DBD interventions may be worth testing to improve treatment effectiveness for boys with a prior history of IPV.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 360 mother participants displaced by Hurricane Katrina completed self-report measures across four time points related to Hurricane exposure, trauma history, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Additionally, the youth offspring completed a self-report measure of posttraumatic stress symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified three main trajectories typical of female PTS symptoms following disaster and was the first known study to document associations between PTS outcomes among adults and their offspring impacted by a large natural disaster. Future research is warranted and should explore additional risk and protective factors that impact both the parental and child outcomes. RESULTS: Latent Class Growth Analysis demonstrated three primary trajectories emerged among females impacted by Katrina, namely, (1) chronic (4 %), (2) recovering (30 %), and (3) resilient (66 %), respectively. These trajectories were significantly impacted by prior trauma history, but not hurricane exposure. Additionally, data indicated that children whose parents fell into the chronic PTS trajectory also reported high levels of PTS symptoms.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,M11566,10.1503/cmaj.131792,Child abuse and mental disorders in Canada,"Background: Nationally representative Canadian data on the prevalence of child abuse and its relation with mental disorders are lacking. We used contemporary, nationally representative data to examine the prevalence of 3 types of child abuse (physical abuse, sexual abuse and exposure to intimate partner violence) and their association with 14 men tal conditions, including suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Methods: We obtained data from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey: Mental Health, collected from the 10 provinces. Respondents aged 18 years and older were asked about child abuse and were selected for the study sample (n = 23 395). The survey had a multistage stratified cluster design (household response rate 79.8%). Results: The prevalence of any child abuse was 32% (individual types ranged from 8% to 26%). All types of child abuse were associated with all mental conditions, including suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, after adjustment for sociodemographic variables (adjusted odds ratios ranged from 1.4 to 7.9). We found a dose-response relation, with increasing number of abuse types experienced corresponding with greater odds of mental conditions. Associations between child abuse and attention deficit disorder, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts showed stronger effects for women than men. Interpretation: We found robust associations between child abuse and mental conditions. Health care providers, especially those assessing patients with mental health problems, need to be aware of the relation between specific types of child abuse and certain mental conditions. Success in preventing child abuse could lead to reductions in the prevalence of mental disorders, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. © 2014 Canadian Medical Association or its licensors.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89,M5685,10.1007/7854_2014_308,The spectrum of borderline personality disorder: A neurophysiological view,"Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) has been defined as a personality disorder in all editions of DSM since 1980; namely, DSM III through V. The criteria are a mixture of symptoms and traits; the etiology, a heterogeneous array of genetic, constitutional, and environmental factors. Until recently the diagnosis relied on clinical descriptions. In the last two decades, neurophysiological data, including MRI and fMRI, have established correlates in various brain regions, particularly those involving the frontal lobes and various limbic structures, that show promise of providing a more substantial basis for diagnosis—relying primarily on (internal) brain changes, rather than on (external) clinical observation. Some of the changes in BPD consist of decreased volume in the orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices and smaller volume in both the amygdala and hippocampus, though with heightened reactivity in the amygdala. Similar abnormalities have been noted in bipolar disorders (BDs) and in ADHD, both of which often accompany BPD and share certain clinical features. Persons with strong genetic predisposition to BDs can develop BPD even in the absence of adverse environmental factors; those with extreme adverse environmental factors (chiefly, early sexual molestation) can develop BPD in the absence of bipolar vulnerability. In some BPD patients, both sets of factors are present. As ideal treatment depends on careful analysis of these factors, neurophysiological testing may permit both more rational, brain-based diagnostic decisions and more appropriate therapeutic strategies.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90,M5904,10.1007/s10926-013-9432-2,Changes in pain catastrophizing following physical therapy for musculoskeletal injury: the influence of depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms,"PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the factors that influence the change in pain catastrophizing during the course of a physical therapy intervention for musculoskeletal injury. METHODS: 187 clients enrolled in a 7-week physical therapy intervention were divided into four mutually exclusive groups on the basis of a pre-treatment assessment: (1) clients whose pre-treatment catastrophizing scores and measures of mental health problems were below clinical threshold, (2) clients whose pre-treatment catastrophizing scores were above clinical threshold but who scores on measures of mental health problems were below clinical threshold, (3) clients whose pre-treatment catastrophizing scores were above clinical threshold and whose scores on measures of mental health problems were also above clinical threshold, and (4) clients whose pre-treatment catastrophizing scores were below clinical threshold but whose scores on measures of mental health problems were above clinical threshold. RESULTS: The most prevalent risk profile consisted of clients with high levels of pain catastrophizing and high mental health problems (37 %), followed by the low catastrophizing and low mental health problems profile (35 %), the high catastrophizing and low mental health problems profile (16 %), and low catastrophizing and high mental health problems profile (10 %). Clients were considered non-responders if their post-treatment catastrophizing score remained above clinical threshold following treatment. Chi square analyses revealed a significantly higher proportion of non-responders in the high catastrophizing and mental health problem group than in any other group. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of mental health symptoms markedly reduces the effectiveness of physical therapy for reducing catastrophizing scores. The 'risk value' of high catastrophizing scores thus appears to vary as a function of the presence or absence of mental health symptoms. The findings argue for the inclusion of measures of mental health problems in the routine screening of individuals treated in physical therapy.",2014.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Outcomes and risk factors for these pattern groups were examined. Participants were children (n = 353; ages 8-15 years) affected by Hurricane Katrina. Children were assessed at 3-7 months (Time 1) and 14-17 months (Time 2) post-Katrina. Results identified three pattern groups (No Disturbance, PTS Only, and Mixed Internalizing) at Time 1. Children in the No Disturbance group reported the lowest levels of internal distress, while the Mixed Internalizing group reported the highest levels of internal distress at Time 2. The Mixed Internalizing and the PTS Only groups reported greater school problems than the No Disturbance group at Time 2. Perceived life threat and community violence exposure were risk factors associated with higher likelihood of falling in the PTS Only and Mixed Internalizing groups, compared to the No Disturbance group. Immediate loss and disruption was also a risk factor associated with a higher likelihood of falling in the PTS Only group, compared to the No Disturbance group. Finally, social support from parents or a classmate/friend was a significant protective factor associated with a lower likelihood of falling into a symptomatic pattern group.

93,M8220,10.1007/s12144-015-9338-6,Hurricane Katrina: Maternal depression trajectories and child outcomes,"The authors examined depression trajectories over two years among mothers exposed to Hurricane Katrina. Risk and protective factors for depression trajectories, as well as associations with child outcomes were analyzed. This study included 283 mothers (age at time 1, M = 39.20 years, SD = 7.21; 62 % African American). Mothers were assessed at four time points over two years following Hurricane Katrina. Mothers reported posttraumatic stress symptoms, hurricane exposure, traumatic life events, and social support at time 1. Depressive symptoms were modeled at times 2, 3, and 4. Youth reported their distress symptoms (posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety) at time 4. Latent class growth analyses identified three maternal depression trajectories among mothers exposed to Hurricane Katrina: low (61 %), resilient (29 %), and chronic (10 %). Social support was identified as a protective factor among mothers. Three main trajectories of maternal depression following Hurricane Katrina were identified. Social support was protective for mothers. Identified trajectories were not associated with children's distress outcomes. These results have implications for disaster responses, screening efforts, and interventions targeted towards families. Future studies warrant the investigation of additional risk and protective factors that can affect maternal and child outcomes.

95,M5147,10.1037/abn0000098,Additive genetic risk from five serotonin system polymorphisms interacts with interpersonal stress to predict depression,"Behavioral genetic research supports polygenic models of depression in which many genetic variations each contribute a small amount of risk, and prevailing diathesis-stress models suggest gene-environment interactions (GxE). Multilocus profile scores of additive risk offer an approach that is consistent with polygenic models of depression risk. In a first demonstration of this approach in a GxE predicting depression, we created an additive multilocus profile score from 5 serotonin system polymorphisms (1 each in the genes HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2C, and 2 in TPH2). Analyses focused on 2 forms of interpersonal stress as environmental risk factors. Using 5 years of longitudinal diagnostic and life stress interviews from 387 emerging young adults in the Youth Emotion Project, survival analyses show that this multilocus profile score interacts with major interpersonal stressful life events to predict major depressive episode onsets (hazard ratio HR] = 1.815, p = .007). Simultaneously, there was a significant protective effect of the profile score without a recent event (HR = 0.83, p = .030). The GxE effect with interpersonal chronic stress was not significant (HR = 1.15, p = .165). Finally, effect sizes for genetic factors examined ignoring stress suggested such an approach could lead to overlooking or misinterpreting genetic effects. Both the GxE effect and the protective simple main effect were replicated in a sample of early adolescent girls (N = 105). We discuss potential benefits of the multilocus genetic profile score approach and caveats for future research.

96,M5863,10.3109/02699052.2014.976594,The contribution of psychological factors to recovery after mild traumatic brain injury: Is cluster analysis a useful approach?,"Objectives: Outcomes after mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) vary, with slow or incomplete recovery for a significant minority. This study examines whether groups of cases with shared psychological factors but with different injury outcomes could be identified using cluster analysis. Method: This is a prospective observational study following 147 adults presenting to a hospital-based emergency department or concussion services in Christchurch, New Zealand. This study examined associations between baseline demographic, clinical, psychological variables (distress, injury beliefs and symptom burden) and outcome 6 months later. A two-step approach to cluster analysis was applied (Ward's method to identify clusters, K-means to refine results). Results: Three meaningful clusters emerged (high-adapters, medium-adapters, low-adapters). Baseline cluster-group membership was significantly associated with outcomes over time. High-adapters appeared recovered by 6-weeks and medium-adapters revealed improvements by 6-months. The low-adapters continued to endorse many symptoms, negative recovery expectations and distress, being significantly at risk for poor outcome more than 6-months after injury (OR (good outcome)=0.12; CI=0.03-0.53; p<0.01). Conclusions: Cluster analysis supported the notion that groups could be identified early post-injury based on psychological factors, with group membership associated with differing outcomes over time.

Methods: Participants were 606 people from three Australian jurisdictions who reported past month injecting, snorting, chewing or smoking of a pharmaceutical opioid and had engaged in these practices at least monthly in the past 6. months. Baseline interviews were conducted prior to introduction of Reformulated OxyContin® in April 2014. Patterns of opioid use and cohort characteristics were examined according to whether participants were prescribed opioid medications, or exclusively used diverted medication. Results: The cohort reported high levels of moderate/severe depression (61%), moderate/severe anxiety (43%), post-traumatic stress disorder (42%), chronic pain or disability (past 6. months, 54%) and pain (past month, 47%). Lifetime use of oxycodone, morphine, opioid substitution medications and codeine were common. Three-quarters (77%) reported ICD-10 lifetime pharmaceutical opioid dependence and 40% current heroin dependence. Thirteen percent reported past year overdose, and 70% reported at least one past month opioid injection-related injury or disease. The cohort displayed complex clinical profiles, but participants currently receiving opioid substitution therapy who were also prescribed other opioids particularly reported a wide range of risk behaviors, despite their health service engagement. Conclusions: Findings highlight the heterogeneity in the patterns and clinical correlates of opioid use among people who tamper with pharmaceutical opioids. Targeted health interventions are essential to reduce the associated harms. © 2015.",2015.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,M8257,,Risk for Compassion Fatigue among doctor of nursing practice students,"Background/Objectives: Compassion fatigue (CF) is severe emotional and physical exhaustion resulting from unresolved burnout and/or secondary traumatic stress. Prevalent in registered nurses and physicians, CF negatively impacts both the caregiver and the care provided and is associated with job attrition. There is no direct measure for CF. Risk is assigned according to the intensity of each constituent part and the relationships between these parts. The purpose of this practice inquiry was to describe the risk for CF among doctor of nursing practice (DNP) students seeking nurse practitioner certification, a previously unstudied and potentially at-risk population. Design: A descriptive study was performed to describe: 1) the prevalence of compassion satisfaction; 2) the prevalence of burnout; 3) the prevalence of secondary traumatic stress; 4) the prevalence of risk profiles developed by Stamm (2010); and 5) the relationship between demographic characteristics and CF risk profiles in a sample of DNP students. Setting: The University of Arizona, College of Nursing between August 24, 2013 and November 19, 2013. Participants: 59 graduate nursing students seeking nurse practitioner certification and a DNP degree self-selected to participate in the study. Measurements: The Professional Quality of Life Scale-5 (ProQOL 5) was utilized to measure the components of CF: compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress. Patient demographics included: gender, age, years in nursing, nursing specialty, and employment status. Results: The DNP student population appears to be at-risk for CF, with 69% of the sample falling outside of the ""low risk"" CF profile. Stamm's (2010) five risk profiles were expanded to assign a level of risk to the 63% of participants who did not land in an existing profile. There were no statistically significant relationships between demographic variables and the expanded CF risk profiles, consistent with previous studies on the individual ProQOL components. A weak trend of increasing CF risk with years of nursing practice suggests that accumulated exposure to suffering increases CF risk. However, a small sample size and self-normalization in the ProQOL 5 limit the generalizability of the findings. Conclusion: DNP students are an at-risk population; therefore, we recommend incorporation of CF awareness and risk reduction into the DNP curriculum. Applicability of the ProQOL 5 test is hindered by scoring inconsistencies and self-normalization bias and we propose solutions. We additionally propose the concept of a single numeric index to quantify individual CF risk. Use of a single continuous variable pertaining to CF risk is likely to be crucial for future characterization, screening, and interventions.

99,M5868,,Examining the influence of peritraumatic dissociation on treatment outcomes and symptom severity among women substance users,"Substance use disorders (SUDs) continue to be associated with significant mental health problems (Brady & Randall, 1999; Finney, Moos, & Timko, 1999; Schukit, 2006). SUDs are commonly associated with other psychological disorders, thus complicating treatment for these populations and influencing treatment outcomes (Najt, Fusar-Poli, & Brambilla, 2011; Compton, Cottler, Abdallah, & Spitznagel, 2003). Women with substance use disorders (SUDs) have co-occurring disorders (Mangrum, Spence, & Steinley-Bumgarner, 2006), more impaired psychological and occupational functioning and often have difficulty adhering to treatment regimens (Mangrum, Spence, & Steinley-Bumgarner, 2006). Exposure to trauma is often related to the onset of several psychological disorders and has been shown to significantly predict substance use (Dansky, Brady, Saladin, Killeen, Becker, & Roitzsch, 1996). Peritraumatic dissociation (PD) is a specific symptom cluster associated with trauma exposure. It is defined as emotional numbing, detachment, and memory impairments shortly after a traumatic experience (van der Velden & Wittmann, 2008). PD has been found to significantly predict PTSD among college students (Bernat, Ronfeldt, Calhoun, & Arias, 1998) and women with histories of trauma (Olde, van der Hart, Kleber, van Son, Wijen, & Pop, 2005). However, neither of these studies examined the influence of PD symptoms among women with histories of SUDs who have been shown to be at higher risk for long term psychological dysfunction and poorer treatment outcomes (Levin, Ilgen, & Moos, 2007). It is unclear how PD influences psychological symptoms, making it difficult to determine what (if any) influence PD symptoms have on treatment outcomes or psychological functioning. Procedures: In the original study (Hien et al., 2005), interested women were asked to consent on IRB approved written consent forms. Next, the participants were screened to ensure they met the inclusion criteria for substance abuse or dependence and PTSD or subthreshold PTSD. Once the baseline assessment was completed, each site randomly assigned participants into the trauma or WHE group. Data on treatment service utilization, abstinence, PTSD symptom severity, global psychiatric symptoms, and substance use severity were collected across four time intervals. Results and Discussion: The findings did not support hypothesis one. Specifically. PD did not predict days of substance abuse or treatment utilization at 6 months. The results did support hypothesis two baseline as PD symptom severity was significantly associated with greater psychiatric symptom severity and more PTSD symptoms at all four time intervals. The findings did not support the hypothesis that PD symptoms were associated with greater substance use severity. The results also revealed that relationship between PD and PTSD is weaker among African Americans than Whites. This study clearly demonstrates the relation of PD to psychiatric symptoms among substance using women with trauma histories. The findings suggest that addressing trauma generally and PD specifically may be essential to psychological functioning among women with histories of trauma and SUDs. These findings have been consistent in the literature and suggest that PD symptoms are associated with greater psychological impairments (Sibranji, et.al, 2012; Breh & Seidler, 2007).

The authors compared individually delivered-mantram repetition therapy and another non-trauma-focused treatment for PTSD. Method: The study was a two-site, open-allocation, blinded-assessment randomized trial involving 173 veterans diagnosed with military-related PTSD from two Veterans Affairs outpatient clinics (January 2012 to March 2014). The mantram group (N = 89) learned skills for silent mantram repetition, slowing thoughts, and one-pointed attention. The comparison group (N = 84) received present-centered therapy, focusing on currently stressful events and problem-solving skills. Both treatments were delivered individually in eight weekly 1-hour sessions. The primary outcome measure was change in PTSD symptom severity, as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and by self-report. Secondary outcome measures included insomnia, depression, anger, spiritual well-being, mindfulness, and quality of life. Intent-to-treat analysis was conducted using linear mixed models. Results: The mantram group had significantly greater improvements in CAPS score than the present-centered therapy group, both at the posttreatment assessment (between-group difference across time, -9.98, 95% CI = -3.63, -16.00; d = 0.49) and at the 2-month follow-up (between-group difference, -9.34, 95% CI = -1.50, 217.18; d = 0.46). Self-reported PTSD symptom severity was also lower in the mantram group compared with the present-centered therapy group at the posttreatment assessment, but there was no difference at the 2-month follow-up. Significantly more participants in the mantram group (59%) than in the present-centered therapy group (40%) who completed the 2-month follow-up no longer met criteria for PTSD (p =10-point improvements) in CAPS score did not differ significantly between groups. Reductions in insomnia were significantly greater for participants in the mantram group at both posttreatment assessment and 2-month follow-up. Conclusions: In a sample of veterans with PTSD, individually delivered mantram repetition therapy was generally more effective than present-centered therapy for reducing PTSD symptom severity and insomnia.

101,M7681,10.3389/fmed.2021.666914,"Fibromyalgia and Associated Disorders: From Pain to Chronic Suffering, From Subjective Hypersensitivity to Hypersensitivity Syndrome","The concept of fibromyalgia has progressed to achieve a certain consensus regarding the definition of the condition. We summarize what is known in 2020, be it in terms of diagnosis, with the criteria that have changed over the years, or at the level of the psychological profile, via the notions of “catastrophizing” and “coping” and post-traumatic syndrome. The importance of fatigue and sleep disorders is underlined, with the chronological sequence of post-traumatic syndrome, chronic fatigue, and then amplification of the pain and the onset of multiple associated symptoms. The etiopathogenic debate has been enriched thanks to neuro-imaging data to discover the start of the central neurological signature. The many associated symptoms are reanalyzed in the context of so-called sister conditions which form sometimes more or less separate entities, such as chronic fatigue syndrome or restless legs syndrome for example. What these conditions have in common is hypersensitivity, not just to pain, but also to all exteroceptive stimuli, from deep sensitivity in the neuro-vegetative system, the sense organs and certain functions of the central nervous system, to the psychological aspects and sleep control. In summary, it is possible to define fibromyalgia as a cognitive disorder of cortical integration of chronic pain, with amplification of painful and sensory nociception, decrease in the threshold for the perception of pain, and persistence of a stimulus that maintains the process in chronicity. Fibromyalgia is part of a group of chronic hypersensitivity syndromes of central origin, with a very wide range of means of expression.",2021.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to replicate previous associations of miRNAs with antidepressant treatment response in a sample of older adults diagnosed with late-life depression. Methods: Our sample included 184 older adults diagnosed with moderately severe depression that received open-label venlafaxine (up to 300 mg/day) for approximately 12 weeks. We quantified miRNA expression levels at baseline and week 12 for miRNAs miR-1202, miR-135a-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-146b-5p, miR-425-3p, and miR-24-3p to explore their association with remission status, response trajectories, and time-to-remission. Results: At T0 and T12, there were no differences in miRNA expression levels between remitters and non-remitters. However, remitters showed a trend toward higher baseline miR-135a-5p (Median = 11.3 9.9, 15.7], p = .083). Prior to correction, baseline miR-135a-5p expression levels showed an association with remission status (OR = 1.8 1.0, 3.3], p = .037). Individuals with higher baseline miR-135a-5p showed better response trajectories (F = 4.5, FDR-corrected p = 4.4 × 10−4), particularly at weeks 10 and 12 (p <. 05). In addition, individuals with higher miR-135a-5p expression reached remission faster than those with lower expression (HR = 0.6 0.4, 0.9], FDR-corrected p = .055). Limitations: Although the sample size was relatively modest, our findings are consistent with the literature suggesting that higher miR-135a-5p levels may be associated with better antidepressant treatment response.

METHOD: We studied 677 spouse dyads (n = 1354) drawn from a community survey (response 82.4%) in post-conflict Timor-Leste. We used culturally adapted measures of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), psychological distress, explosive anger and grief. RESULTS: Latent class analysis identified three classes of couples: class 1, comprising women with higher trauma events (TEs), men with intermediate TEs (19%); class 2, including men with higher TEs, women with lower TEs (23%); and class 3, comprising couples in which men and women had lower TE exposure (58%) (the reference group). Men and women partners of survivors of higher TE exposure (classes 1 and 2) had increased symptoms of explosive anger and grief compared with the reference class (class 3). Women partners of survivors of higher TE exposure (class 2) had a 20-fold increased rate of PTSD symptoms compared with the reference class, a pattern that was not evident for men living with women exposed to higher levels of trauma (class 1). CONCLUSIONS: Men and women living with survivors of higher levels of trauma showed an increase in symptoms of grief and explosive anger. The manifold higher rate of PTSD symptoms amongst women living with men exposed to high levels of trauma requires replication.

104,M9411,10.1097/CXA.0000000000000171,The Differences between Gamblers and Substance Users Who Seek Treatment,"Background and Objectives: Gambling disorder (GD) and substance use disorder (SUD) are diagnostically similar and share many etiological, clinical, and psychosocial factors. However, even among individuals who gamble, treatment-seeking (TS) rates appear much higher for SUD than GD. Methods: An analysis was conducted on data from an online survey of 10,199 Canadian adults (18+) over-selected for gambling participation to explore the basis of these differences. Results: Fewer respondents sought treatment for GD (6.8%; 91/1346) relative to SUD (30.3%; 236/778). Respondents seeking treatment for substance use (TS-SUD) had significantly higher levels of childhood abuse, generalized anxiety, and withdrawal/cravings, whereas respondents seeking gambling treatment (TS-GD) had higher overall addiction severity. A final analysis identified 8 variables as predictive of TS, with 5 of these occurring at higher rates in respondents with SUD: younger age, more past year negative life events, childhood abuse, post-traumatic stress, and not engaging in their addiction longer or with heavier use than intended. By comparison, greater addiction severity was the only predictor of TS that was more prevalent in respondents with GD. Conclusion: The present results indicate that (a) fewer respondents sought gambling treatment relative to substance use treatment; (b) TS-SUD is associated with a more prominent comorbidity profile; and (c) the higher rate of TS for SUD compared with GD is due, in part, to people with SUD having more general factors that are predictive of TS (eg, comorbidities).

Model 1 included effects of risk factors at ages 4 and 5 on child depression symptoms at age 6. Model 2 also included depression symptoms at all three ages to examine changes in these symptoms. Model 1 revealed that age 4 and 5 parental depression, NA, EC, and SR predicted age 6 child depression levels, Several age 4 variables had indirect pathways to age 6 depression via age 5 EC. Model 2 revealed that preschool depression was the only age 4 variable, and EC and SR were the only age 5 variables that significantly predicted increases in age 6 depression. These findings highlight the role of self-regulation in child depression and suggest that targeting self-regulation may be an effective prevention and intervention strategy.

However, such a long research tool has the potential to become problematic for use in epidemiological and clinical settings. Therefore, an ultra-brief measure for AjD (ADNM-4) was established and validated in a recent study conducted with a representative national sample. The aim of the present study was to revalidate the ultra-brief ADNM-4 Scale, as well as to reestablish cutoff scores for clinical use. An online survey was conducted with a convenience sample of 484 Israelis aged 18-65 years, who were recruited via social media. Participants filled out self-report questionnaires dealing with diagnostic criteria of stress-related disorders, that is, AjD (the original and ultra-brief modules), prolonged grief disorder, depression, anxiety, and hypochondriasis. Construct, discriminant, and convergent validity were assessed via confirmatory factor analysis and correlation coefficients, while cutoff scores were established through receiver-operating characteristic analysis. The findings confirmed the ultra-brief module's validity. The high fit indices indicated construct validity, and the correlations with the various stress-related disorders indicated good convergent and discriminant validity. Cutoff scores resembled earlier cutoff scores calculated with a representative national sample, indicating a consistent and accurate diagnostic ability. These findings provide additional evidence for the psychometric characteristics of the ADNM-4, which seems to be a suitable brief screening tool for assessing AjD symptoms according to the ICD-11 definition. Therefore, the ADNM-4 is recommended in cases where prompt screening is required, as well as for research purposes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",2019.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This assessment is performed in clinical practice using the clinical routine interview technique. Domains of the clinical routine interview are, among others, present symptoms, history of present illness and family and developmental history. Family and developmental history are important parts in the diagnostic process of ADHD. In contrast to the domains of present symptoms and history of present illness, there are currently no structured interviews or rating scales available to thoroughly assess family and developmental history in ADHD. The aim of the study was to assess the profile of operationalized data from a structured clinical routine interview addressing family and developmental history from ADHD patients and control participants. A structured interview to assess family and developmental history was derived from the guidelines used at different university hospitals for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry as well as from the descriptions in leading textbooks. Based on these guidelines and descriptions, the interview was an optimization of possible questions. Clinical data were obtained from parents of male patients who had the diagnosis of ADHD between the ages of 12–17 years (n = 44), and of healthy controls (n = 41). Non-metric data were operationalized into three categories, 0—normal behavior, 1—minor pathological behavior, 2—major pathological behavior. ADHD patients express a profile that significantly differs from control participants. Comparison of significant items with the empirical ADHD literature indicates strong agreement.

Recent Findings: Research indicates that intranasal oxytocin is a low-cost and easily accessible medication with an excellent safety profile. Oxytocin holds promise for facilitating more effective PTSD treatment, particularly when used in combination with evidence-supported psychotherapy interventions. There is still a significant need to identify the mechanisms of action underlying oxytocin treatment of PTSD and to maximize methods of nasal spray delivery, examine dose-response outcomes, and clarify the characteristics of individuals and populations that are most likely to benefit from adjunctive oxytocin treatment. Summary: Collectively, preclinical and human laboratory research suggest that oxytocin may be an effective mechanism by which treatment outcomes for PTSD and common comorbidities can be enhanced. Adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to address efficacy, identify predictors of treatment outcome, and to assess the use of intranasal oxytocin within appropriate PTSD populations. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2019.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A longitudinal study (N = 1,041) was conducted through an online survey with two measurements: at two and five weeks after the declaration of the alarm state in Spain. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depressive symptoms, spiritual wellbeing and perceived loneliness were evaluated by screening tests. Means and their confidence intervals (95%) were calculated for all variables in the study, for the three age groups: 18-30, 31-59, 60-80. Linear mixed models with random slopes (Time nested to Subjects) were calculated for each variable. The results indicate that the psychological impact caused by the pandemic persists over time, and even increases in some of the variables studied. The older age group (60-80 years) shows the least impact and the greatest well-being. They presented less depressive, anxious and PTSD symptoms and less loneliness.

Se realizo un estudio longitudinal (N = 1.041) mediante una encuesta online con dos mediciones: a las dos y cinco semanas de la declaracion del estado de alarma en Espana. Se evaluaron mediante cuestionarios de deteccion los sintomas de trastorno de estres postraumatico (TEPT), ansiedad y depresion, bienestar espiritual y soledad percibida. Se calcularon las medias y sus intervalos de confianza (95%) para todas las variables del estudio, para los tres grupos de edad: 18-30, 31-59, 60-80. Para cada variable se calcularon modelos lineales mixtos con pendientes aleatorias (tiempo anidado a los sujetos). El impacto psicologico persiste a lo largo del tiempo, aumentando en algunas de las variables. El grupo de mayor edad muestra menor impacto y mayor bienestar. Presentan menos sintomas de depresion, ansiedad y TEPT y menos soledad. Estos resultados pueden explicarse por la mayor resiliencia de este grupo para recuperarse de situaciones adversas, y el mayor numero de estrategias de afrontamiento.

110,M6886,10.1080/20008198.2018.1558708,Treating children and adolescents with multiple traumas: A randomized clinical trial of narrative exposure therapy,"Background and Objective: Millions of children and adolescents worldwide suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other problems due to prolonged exposure to traumatizing events. Forms of cognitive-behavioural therapy are the most commonly used treatment for PTSD, but evidence from sophisticated studies in clinical settings among children is limited. Method: This multicentre, parallel, non-blinded, pragmatic randomized controlled trial assessed the effectiveness of narrative exposure therapy (NET) in traumatized children and adolescents. Fifty 9-17-year-old participants, who had experienced prolonged traumatic conditions in the form of refugeedom or family violence and suffered from PTSD symptoms, were randomized into NET (n = 29) and treatment as usual (TAU; n = 21) active control groups. The objective was to determine whether NET can be feasibly implemented within the existing healthcare system of a high-income country and whether it would reduce mental health problems, especially PTSD, and increase resilience, in children and adolescents with multiple traumas more effectively than TAU. We hypothesized that NET would be more effective than TAU in reducing symptoms and increasing resilience. Results: Analysis of variance revealed that PTSD and psychological distress, but not depression symptoms, decreased regardless of treatment group. Resilience increased in both groups. Within-group analyses showed that the decrease in PTSD symptoms was significant in the NET group only. The effect sizes were large in NET but small in TAU. Concerning PTSD symptom cut-off scores, the reduction in the share of participants with clinical-level PTSD was significant in the NET group only. Intention-to-treat analyses using linear mixed models confirmed these results. Conclusions: Despite its shortcomings, this study gives preliminary support for the safety, effectiveness, and usefulness of NET among multiply traumatized children and adolescents in clinical settings. Close attention must be paid to the implementation of the new intervention as an everyday tool in healthcare.

Formas de terapia cognitivo-conductual son las mas comunmente usadas para tratar el TEPT, pero evidencias con disenos sofisticados con ninos en ambientes clinicos son limitados. Metodos: Condujimos un estudio multicentrico, paralelo, no ciego, pragmatico aleatoriamente controlado y estudiamos la efectividad de la Terapia de Exposicion Narrativa (NET) en ninos y adolescentes traumatizados. Un total de 50 participantes entre 9 y 17 anos, quienes habian experimentado condiciones traumaticas prolongadas como refugiados o violencia familiar y sufrido de sintomas de TEPT, fueron puestos en forma aleatoria en grupos de NET (n = 29) y tratamiento usual como control (TAU por sus siglas en ingles; n = 21). El objetivo del estudio era encontrar si la NET puede ser implementada de manera factible en el sistema de salud existente de un pais de altos ingresos y si puede reducir los problemas de salud mental, especialmente TEPT, y aumentar la resiliencia, en ninos y adolescentes con multiples traumas mas efectivamente que el TAU. Nuestra hipotesis era que la NET seria mas efectiva en reducir los sintomas y aumentaria mas la resiliencia que el TAU. Resultados: los resultados ANOVA revelaron que el TEPT y la angustia psicologica, pero no los sintomas depresivos, disminuyeron sin importar el grupo en el cual fueron tratados. La resiliencia aumento en ambos grupos. Los analisis intra-grupo mostraron que hubo una disminucion significativa en los sintomas de TEPT solo en el grupo de la NET. Los tamanos del efecto fueron grandes en la NET, pero pequenos en el TAU. En lo que concierne a los sintomas de TEPT los puntos de corte, una reduccion en la proporcion de participantes con un nivel clinico de TEPT fue significativa solo en el grupo de NET. El analisis de con la intencion de tratar empleando modelos lineales mixtos confirmo estos resultados. Conclusiones: A pesar de las limitaciones del estudio actual, nos da un apoyo preliminar para la seguridad, efectividad y utilidad de la NET entre multiples ninos y adolescentes traumatizados en ambientes clinicos. Se debera prestar mucha atencion a la implementacion de la nueva intervencion como una herramienta del dia a dia en el sistema de salud.

111,M10858,,The traumatic brain: Gender differences in working memory,"The purpose of this Doctoral Research Project is to investigate differences in working memory, attributable to PTSD, between male and female adults. This research project seeks to examine the relationship between the type of trauma and working memory by gender. The presented case study provides a clinical description of Emily Jones, a young woman who is experiencing many social emotional, behavioral, and academic difficulties, including working memory deficits due to persistent symptoms of posttraumatic stress from childhood trauma. Ms. Jones's presenting problems, psychological profile and diagnostic formulation will be provided to support a treatment plan based on the evidence based practices for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. A research proposal to study the gender differences in working memory deficits because of childhood trauma will be presented to better understand how biological and environmental influences may affect our clients differently. A causal comparative research design is proposed to recruit a purposive sample of 164 male and female adults with a diagnosis of PTSD to anonymously participate in this study. Each participant would be administered the Working Memory Index from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition and asked to indicate the type of trauma experienced based from the Dimensions of Trauma model. To describe the characteristics of the sample, preliminary descriptive statistics will be calculated. A Two-way between groups Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) would be used to analyze the differences in working memory between gender and types of trauma. Given what we know about PTSD and the effects it has on the working memory and how symptoms of PTSD is experienced differently between males and females, there is reason to believe that working memory is also effected differently between males and females.

112,M8247,10.1017/9781316817155.024,Conclusion: After trauma studies?,"“There is something in trauma that intrinsically invokes a beyond,” says Roger Luckhurst (2010: 11). This “beyond” invokes several layers of meaning. On the one hand, Luckhurst is alluding to the time lag between a traumatic event and the onset of trauma symptoms. This is the belatedness that is captured in the “post-"" of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and in the inherent deferral or “afterwardsness” of trauma encapsulated in Freud’s evocative term Nachträglichkeit, translated by Strachey as “deferred action” (see Freud 1895: I, 356 and 1896: III, 167n). Additionally, the prospect of moving beyond trauma speaks to the hope of working through wounds and arriving at a place of healing. On the other hand, Luckhurst is also referring here to the question of whether trauma theory as a phenomenon has run its course, whether its ideas will continue to have relevance in coming years, and if so under what conditions. Trauma will, of course, always be with us, in the sense that it is a universal experience. The insights of trauma theory, as this volume demonstrates, have profoundly impacted our study of the humanities in general and of literature in particular. The achievement of trauma studies lies in the way that it offers “a critical-theoretical way of attending to and addressing the representation of human suffering and ‘wounding,’ both literal and metaphorical, both personal and communal,” notes Eaglestone (2013: 12). In this regard, the future of literary studies is inevitably “post-traumatic,” given that trauma studies have enriched and irrevocably impacted our critical vocabulary and our conceptual framework. Nevertheless, as time passes and ideas consolidate, there is a sense that perhaps we have bumped up against some of the limits of trauma, or that at times too much has been claimed for it. Will these ideas continue to be relevant in the coming generations? Will trauma theory follow the trajectory of other literary-critical approaches, flourishing for a period until the insufficiencies of its most optimistic claims are revealed, then declining in popularity but leaving behind, like a receding tide, choice ideas and concepts that will always remain part of the field? Some signs of this decline are already evident, for example, in the way that memory studies is in some places replacing trauma as a central disciplinary category. © Cambridge University Press 2018.",2018.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
113,M9223,10.1093/schbul/sby016.280,Identification of neuroanatomical surrogate markers of childhood trauma,"Background: Childhood trauma (CT) plays an important role in psychiatric disorders. It is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorders like major depression, anxiety disorders, dependency, post-traumatic stress disorders and even psychosis. There is a high incidence of CT in patients with psychosis, especially for physical and sexual abuse. Already in UHRindividuals increased CT could be observed. A study of Thompson and colleagues showed that 97% of their UHR sample reported a trauma in the past. 83% of the cases were physical abuse, 67% emotional abuse and 27% sexual abuse. Our aim was to investigate if there are neurobiological surrogate markers of trauma existing which can be detected by a multi pattern analysis. Methods: PRONIA ('Personalized Prognostic Tools for Early Psychosis Management') is a prospective collaboration project funded by the European Union under the 7th Framework Programme (grant agreement no 602152). Considering a broad set of variables (sMRI, rsMRI, DTI, psychopathological, life event related and sociobiographic data, neurocognition, genomics and other blood derived parameters) as well as advanced statistical methods, PRONIA aims at developing an innovative multivariate prognostic tool enabling an individualized prediction of illness trajectories and outcome. Seven clinical centers in five European countries and in Australia participate in the evaluation of three clinical groups (subjects clinically at high risk of developing a psychosis CHR], patients with a recent onset psychosis ROP] and patients with a recent onset depression ROD]) as well as healthy controls; planned sample size is n=1680. CT was assessed by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). To identify neuroanatomical and functional surrogate markers of CT, a multi pattern analysis via Neurominer (NM) was conducted. An additional VBM analysis was performed to evaluate the results of the NM analysis. Results: We found that patients and HC could be separated very well by the CTQ pattern. Moreover, the classification among the patient groups yielded results that were not much better than a random classification. This finding underlines that CT is an overarching risk factor for mental diseases and not specific for single clinical entities. Furthermore, the decision scores that were conducted in the first NM analysis revealed highly significant negative correlations with grey matter changes in frontotemporal cortical areas, the anterior cingulate and the insular cortex. These areas are already discussed for CT in the literature. Discussion: CT seems to be a global risk factor for psychiatric disorders. Moreover, we could re-examine the results of our multi variate analysis successfully in a VBM procedure.",2018.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
114,M8972,10.1111/sltb.12831,Trajectories of suicidal ideation following separation from military service: Overall trends and group differences,"BACKGROUND: Although the transition out of military service is a high-risk time for suicidal ideation (SI), a paucity of research examines the development of SI during this transition process and veteran subgroups at risk for SI as they readjust to civilian life. METHODS: A population-based, longitudinal post-9/11 veteran cohort reported SI frequency at 3, 9, 15, 21, and 27 months post-separation using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. We identified distinct trajectories of SI over time (i.e., classes) using latent class growth analysis and examined demographic and military service predictors of class membership overall and by gender using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Four SI trajectories that were similar across genders were identified: resilient (90.1%), delayed onset (5.0%), remitting (2.7%), and chronic (2.2%). Younger age, minority race/ethnicity, medical and other (vs. honorable) separation types, and Veterans Health Administration service utilization were associated with increased odds of assignment to a higher-risk trajectory (delayed onset, remitting, and/or chronic vs. resilient), whereas continued service in the National Guard/Reserves and officer rank was associated with lower odds of assignment to a higher-risk trajectory. CONCLUSIONS: Findings regarding veterans at greatest risk for SI following military separation can inform targeted assessment and early intervention efforts.",2022.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
115,M7696,,"Burnout and sick leave due to mental disorders: Heritability, comorbidity, risk factors and adverse outcomes","Common mental disorders are an increasing public health problem worldwide, and in Sweden the incidence of sick leave due to stress-related mental disorders has more than doubled since 2010. The aim of this thesis was to explore genetic and environmental aspects of burnout and sick leave due to stress-related and other mental disorders. Data from the population based Swedish Twin Registry's questionnaire study STAGE (the Study of Twin Adults Genes and Environment) and population registers, including the MiDAS (MicroData for Analyses of the Social insurance) register, were usedStudy I was cross-sectional and included 25 378 twins that responded to STAGE. A multivariate biometric twin model was used to assess to what degree the covariation between major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and burnout, was explained by common genetic and environmental factors in women and men. A latent common factor explained that the covariation was influenced 58% by genetics and 42% by unique environment.Studies II-III were prospective and contained 23 611 and 11 729 STAGE responders respectively. Information from the MiDAS register was used to follow up for sick leave. In Study II logistic regression with co-twin control and a bivariate twin model was used to assess whether the associations between burnout and sick leave due to stress-related mental disorders, other mental disorders, and somatic conditions, was influenced by familial factors(genetics and shared environment). The phenotypic correlation between burnout and sick leave due to stress-related mental disorders (0.26), and between burnout and sick leave due to other mental disorders (0.30) was explained by genetic factors. The association between burnout and sick leave due to somatic conditions was modest and not influenced by familial factors. In Study III, logistic regression models were used to assess whether psychosocial work environment and health behaviors were risk factors for sick leave due to mental disorders and if the associations were influenced by familial factors. Job strain was a risk factor for sick leave due to mental disorders, after controlling for familial factors, while noneof the health behaviors showed independent associations with sick leave due to mental disordersStudy IV was register based and contained 2202 individuals on sick leave due to a mental disorder 2005-2006, according to MiDAS, and their 2202 co twins. Cox proportional hazards regression models with co-twin control was used to investigate the short and long term effect of sick leave due to mental disorders on the outcomes reoccurring sick leave, disability pension, and unemployment, while taking familial factors into account. The risk of reoccurring sick leave was more than 3 times higher for the first two years of follow up. The risk of disability pension was 12 times higher the first year and remained almost 3 times higher throughout the rest of the follow-up time. The twice as high risk for long-term unemployment was consistent over the up to 8-year follow-up time.In conclusion, burnout shares a genetic vulnerability with depression, anxiety, and sick leave due to mental disorders. Job strain is a risk factor for sick leave due to mental disorders regardless of familial predisposition. Sick leave due to mental disorders is a public health problem that may have serious consequences, both for individuals and to society as a whole.

Insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying this vulnerability can help design targeted strategies for improvement of HS tolerance. Red blood cells (RBC) and white blood cells (WBC) were isolated from red jungle fowl and 4 lines of commercial modern broilers. Lines A and B are considered standard-yielding lines, whereas Lines C and D are high-yielding. Cells were cultured at either 37°C or 45°C for 2 h to induce heat stress (HS). Gene expression of cytokines, chemokines, and inflammasome components were measured. Heat shock proteins 27 and 70 (HSPs) in RBC were significantly affected by line (P 30-fold, P < 0.0001) in Line C. Inflammasome genes (NLRP3, NLRC5 and NLRC3) were significantly affected by the line studied (P < 0.05). In WBC, the effect of line was significant for all cytokines, chemokines, and inflammasome components studied (P < 0.05). To examine the mechanical properties of isolated RBC from the 4 commercial lines and jungle fowl, RBC were placed into nematic liquid crystals, where Lines B and D were the most strained, and Line A and the jungle fowl were the least strained. Together, these findings indicate not only the dynamic nature of circulating cells, but the differences in the stress and inflammatory response among commercially available lines and their common ancestor. These profiles have the potential to serve as a future marker for stress responses in broilers, though further study is warranted. © 2022",2022.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is unclear whether both disorders share similar antecedents, which is important to plan efficient interventions. The goal of this study was to examine the contribution of set of biopsychosocial predictors on both PTSD and PPD. Methods: The study design was prospective. The study was conducted at Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada, a public university hospital located in the south of Madrid (Spain). The sample was composed of 116 pregnant women with low pregnancy risk. STROBE reporting guidelines were followed. Results: The multivariate results show that psychopathology severity assessed during the first trimester (ß = 0.50, p <.001) and the Apgar score 5 min after delivery (ß = − 0.19, p =.030) were the two variables to significantly contribute to postpartum depressive symptoms. Conversely, only satisfaction with home care after delivery was independently associated with postpartum posttraumatic stress (ß = − 0.26, p =.016). The proposed model explained 21.8% of the variance of postpartum depressive symptoms (p =.041) and 27.1% of the variance of posttraumatic stress symptoms (p =.014). Conclusion: Special attention should be given to shared and unique predictive factors of PDD and PTSD to develop effective prevention programs in perinatal care. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2021.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the authors have unveiled a wide array of potential therapeutic mechanisms, a precise mechanism of action was not demonstrated. Future studies, using genetic, pharmacological, chemogenetic, and optogenetic tools, will likely be required to establish causal links between OEA behavioral actions and the reported neurobiological changes. Moreover, given that OEA's role as a brain-gut signaling mechanism was discovered partially due to its effect of suppressing homeostatic feeding in rodents it will be crucial to comprehensively profile the effects of OEA on feeding and reward processes generally to confirm that the apparently beneficial effects of OEA are not secondary to a suppressive action on brain reward function.

Using daily reports collected via cell phone, we examined the psychometric properties of alcohol use consequences and evaluations of those consequences. Participants were 349 undergraduate students (mean age 19.7 SD = 1.26], 53.4% female). Data were analyzed using a multilevel factor analysis framework, incorporating binary items (consequences) and normally distributed items (evaluations). Our model converged on 2 factors-positive and negative-with similar loadings between-and within-persons. Intraclass correlation coefficients for positive consequences and their evaluations ranged from .30 to .40, whereas values for negative consequences were more variable. Intraclass correlation coefficients for negative evaluations were higher, suggesting evaluations were more trait-like compared to experience of consequences which may be context dependent. Generalizability coefficients on the whole were good to excellent, suggesting highly reliable scales at both person-mean and daily-mean levels. However, likely due to binary scale and infrequency, the generalizability coefficients for negative consequences at the daily level was somewhat low. Convergent validity was demonstrated by (a) positive associations between baseline Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test scores with latent factors for daily positive and negative consequences, and (b) positive associations between daily drinking and daily consequences and evaluations of consequences. Overall, this measure demonstrated good psychometric properties for use in studies examining daily and lagged relationships between alcohol use and related consequences.",2017.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

121,M6311,10.1080/20008066.2022.2116825,Families following pediatric traumatic medical events: identifying psychosocial risk profiles using latent profile analysis,"Background: Post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) are often experienced by children and family members after pediatric traumatic medical events (PTMEs). Assessing families' psychosocial risk factors is a crucial part of trauma-informed practice as it helps identify risk for PTSS in the aftermath of PTME. Objectives: Using the Psychosocial Assessment Tool 2.0 (PAT2.0), this study describes the psychosocial risk of families following PTMEs in two ways: 1. Describing the psychosocial risk defined by the PAT2.0 based on three-tiered risk levels; 2. Using latent profile analysis (LPA); identifying psychosocial risk profiles and examining how child- and injury-related factors can affect profile membership. Methods: Caregivers of 374 children following PTMEs admitted to a pediatric rehabilitation department in Israel completed the PAT2.0. Total PAT2.0 score and the seven PAT2.0 subscales (family structure/resources, social support, child problems, sibling problems, family problems, caregiver stress reactions, and family beliefs) were included in the first analysis. Mean PAT2.0 scores of three risk categories (universal, targeted, clinical) were calculated; LPA, which allows for cross-sectional latent variable mixture models to identify heterogeneity within a population, and multinomial logistic regressions using six out of the seven PAT2.0 subscales, were used to determine distinct profile differences and predictors of profile membership. Results: The three-tiered risk levels revealed were relatively high, as compared to levels in families of children with other clinical diagnoses. LPA yielded a three-profile solution: low family risk (63.53%); high caregiver stress, above-average levels of family risk (22.5%); and sibling problems, above-average levels of family risk (13.94%). Ethnicity and type of injury predicted group membership. Conclusion: Families of children following PTMEs are at increased psychosocial risk. A clinically useful approach to identifying and preventing PTSS may be to evaluate specific domain patterns rather than just the total PAT2.0 risk level alone, based on the PAT2.0 subscales.",2022.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
122,M11249,,DEPRESSIVE AND ANXIOUS SYMPTOMS AND IMMUNE TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROFILES SEVERAL YEARS POSTPARTUM,"Most research on maternal mental health focuses on the perinatal period and does not extend beyond 12 months postpartum. However, emerging evidence suggests that for some women (30%-50%), depression and anxiety symptoms may persist beyond the first year postpartum. Despite the high prevalence rates and devastating maternal-child consequences, our understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms of maternal mental health beyond the first year postpartum is incomplete. Changes in the immune system, specifically inflammatory and antiviral processes, are thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety disorders in the general population. Therefore, the purpose of the current investigation focuses on women two to three years post-delivery to examine the relationship of depression and anxiety symptoms with transcriptional control pathways relevant to inflammatory and antiviral processes using differential gene expression (DGEs) analyses. Women (N = 33) over 18 years of age self-reported on their levels of depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), anxiety (Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale) and PTSD (Impact of Events Scale) and provided a blood sample approximately 2-3 years post-delivery. DGE analyses revealed that women with clinically elevated symptoms of depression (EPDS>12) anxiety (OASIS>7) and/or PTSD (IES>26) (n =16) had a higher prevalence of genes activated by transcription control pathways associated with inflammation (NF-KB, p=0.004; JUN, p=0.02; CREB, p=0.01) and reduced activation of genes associated with the antiviral response (IRF2, p=0.02) and the glucocorticoid (GR, p=0.02) signaling pathway compared to women without symptoms (n=17). This is one of the first investigations into the immune signaling pathways involved in mood and anxiety disorders two to three years post-delivery. The results of this study suggest that clinically elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD two to three years post-delivery are associated with a gene expression profile characterized by upregulated expression of pro-inflammatory genes and downregulated expression of antiviral genes. The data also points to two potential pathways linking symptoms to increased systematic inflammation: activation of the sympathetic nervous system and reduced hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis activity.",2022.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
123,M8001,10.1016/j.bbr.2020.112686,Effects of early life social experience on fear extinction and related glucocorticoid profiles – behavioral and neurochemical approaches in a rat model of PTSD,"People may agonize over an intrusive fear-inducing memory even when the traumatic event has passed, which is the principle manifestation of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, many traumatized people do not present symptoms of PTSD, implying that certain hidden factors help those individuals to cope with the traumatic stress. Increasing evidence suggests that early life experience may serve as a predisposing factor in the development of PTSD. For example, early life social deprivation disrupts the glucocorticoid system, one of the biological abnormalities of PTSD. By employing isolation rearing (IR) with a subsequent single prolonged stress (SPS) paradigm, we examined the hypothesis that early-life social experience may change the outcome of traumatic stress in both behavioral and neurochemical profiles. Behaviorally, the performance of rats on a Pavlovian fear conditioning test was measured to evaluate their retrieval ability of fear memory extinction. Neurochemically, plasma corticosterone levels and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), FK506-binding proteins 4 and 5 (FKBP4 and FKBP5) and early growth response-1 (Egr-1) expression were measured in GR-abundant brain areas, including the hypothalamus, medial prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. Our results demonstrated an area-dependent IR effect on the SPS outcomes. IR prevented the SPS-impaired fear extinction retrieval ability and averted the SPS-elevated expression of GR, FKBP4, and Egr-1 in the hippocampus, whereas it did not change the SPS-reduced plasma corticosterone levels and SPS-enhanced GR activity in the mPFC and hypothalamus. The present study provides some new insights to support the hypothesis that early-life experience may play a role in the occurrence of PTSD. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One factor that may be important to consider is racial discrimination, which is associated with numerous negative mental health outcomes yet has not been studied in the context of interpersonal traumas for Black women. This study aims to fill this gap by examining the independent and interactive roles of racial discrimination and interpersonal trauma in predicting PTSD symptoms in a community sample of trauma-exposed, Black women (n = 292). Consistent with the previous literature, we found that more frequent experiences of racial discrimination were associated with more severe PTSD symptoms overall (r = .34) and by symptom cluster. Furthermore, we found a significant interaction between experiences of racial discrimination and experiences of interpersonal trauma (b = .46, 95%CI.04,.88], SE = .28; ΔR 2 = .01, p = .03) such that the association between PTSD symptoms and interpersonal trauma was stronger at higher (+1 SD above the mean) levels of racial discrimination. This pattern was replicated for most PTSD symptom clusters.

126,M5228,10.1093/med/9780190908096.003.0007,Comorbidity of bipolar and other psychiatric disorders,"Across the life span, psychiatric comorbidity is common in bipolar disorder and has important implications for assessment, is associated with distinct trajectories of treatment response, and predicts the course of illness and symptom expression. However, the shifts in affective phases that are the hallmark of bipolar disorder complicate the assessment of comorbidity. In this regard, comorbidity has been associated with current illness phase in some samples, although it is noteworthy that the comorbidity is similar between bipolar I and bipolar II disorders. This comorbidity has important treatment implications. As medicine increasingly focuses on personalized treatment approaches that consider the impact of comorbidity on treatment selection, comorbidity patterns in patients with bipolar disorder represent an opportunity to tailor both pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic treatment and eo ipso to improve outcomes. This chapter reviews the prevalence, diagnostic challenges, and treatment implications for the most common co-occurring psychiatric disorders in individuals with bipolar disorder: anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and personality disorders. Consideration of comorbidity is critical in enhancing treatment outcomes for patients and in terms of personalizing treatment approaches, whether pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic.

The aim of this study is to examine distinct processes of social-cognition in this patient group, including attentional processing and recognition, empathic reaction and evoked facial expression in response to discrete vignettes of others displaying positive (i.e. happiness) or negative (i.e. sadness and anger) emotions. Method: One hundred and thirty-eight female participants were included in the study: 73 healthy controls (HCs) and 65 individuals with an ED (49 with Anorexia Nervosa and 16 with Bulimia Nervosa). Self-report and behavioural measures were used. Results: Participants with EDs did not display specific abnormalities in emotional processing, recognition and empathic response to others' basic discrete emotions. However, they had poorer facial expressivity and a tendency to turn away from emotional displays. Conclusion: Treatments focusing on the development of non-verbal emotional communication skills might be of benefit for patients with EDs.

128,M9177,10.1080/15299732.2018.1451805,Assessing the existence of dissociative PTSD in sub-acute patients of whiplash,"Numerous studies investigating dissociative posttraumatic stress disorder (D-PTSD) have emerged. However, there is a lack of studies investigating D-PTSD following a wider range of traumatic exposure. Thus, the present study investigates D-PTSD using latent class analysis (LCA) in sub-acute patients of whiplash and associated risk factors. The results of LCA showed a three-class solution primarily distributed according to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity and thus no indication of D-PTSD. Dissociative symptoms, psychological distress (i.e. anxiety/depression), and pain severity significantly predicted PTSD severity. Combined, the results support the component model of dissociation and PTSD, while still stressing the importance of dissociative symptoms when planning treatment for PTSD.",2019.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
129,M7127,10.1097/TA.0000000000004078,Mental Health Symptoms and Engagement in a Stepped-Care Mental Health Service Among Patients with a Violent Versus Non-Violent Injury,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined mental health symptom trajectories and engagement in mental health follow-up in relation to mechanism of injury. This study examined differences in engagement between survivors of non-violent and violent injury in the Trauma Resilience and Recovery Program (TRRP), a stepped-care, technology-enhanced model that provides evidence-based mental health screening and treatment to patients admitted to our Level I trauma service. METHODS: This study analyzed data from 2,527 adults enrolled in TRRP at hospital bedside between 2018 and 2022, including 398 (16%) patients with a violent injury and 2,129 (84%) patients with a non-violent injury. Bivariate and hierarchical logistic regression analyses examined relations between injury type (violent versus non-violent) engagement in TRRP, and mental health symptoms at 30 day follow up. RESULTS: Engagement in services at bedside was similar across survivors of violent and non-violent traumatic injury. Patients with violent injury had higher levels of PTSD and depressive symptoms 30-days post injury but were less likely to engage in mental health screening. Among patients who screened positive for PTSD and depression, patients with violent injury were more likely to accept treatment referrals. CONCLUSION: Patients with a violent traumatic injury have higher levels of mental health needs yet face greater barriers to accessing mental health services following their injury relative to those with a non-violent injury. Effective strategies are needed to ensure continuity of care and access to mental health care to promote resilience and emotional and functional recovery.

130,M7563,,Gene expression profiling combined with DNA methylation detecting PTSD and postpartum depression,"Identification of risk factors for psychiatric disorders has proven very challenging due to their phenotypic heterogeneity, which impacts all facets of clinical and research psychiatry. If there are different biological subtypes within psychiatric disorders then clustering them as one entity may dilute the effects of genes involved in vulnerability in a specific disease subgroup. We have demonstrated that the biological underpinnings of Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurring in the presence of a defined genetic 1] or environmental background 2] are distinct. Focussing on a homogeneous subgroup of major depressive disorders, we identified the earliest prospective gene expression predictor for Postpartum depression 3] and are currently in the process of replicating and extending these gene expression predictors in a larger cohort from the USA. Recently, for the first time we report that increased epigenetic age acceleration is associated with higher levels of lifetime stress and with higher depressive symptoms, linking biological ageing and to stress and stress-related disorders 4]. In summary, I will demonstrate the intricate mesh of genetic and environmental risk factors and their interplay that underlie psychiatric disorders, with a particular focus on Post-traumatic stress disorder and Postpartum depression among others. Using a systems approach, I will outline how we integrate different types of genomic data including gene expression, genotypes and DNA methylation data to get a holistic understanding of the biological mechanisms and the trajectories that underlie these psychiatric disorders.",2016.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of a Latent Profile Analysis from an Acute, Psychiatric Hospital","Psychiatric inpatient units are used when youth experience severe behavioral or emotional concerns causing significant impairment or needing emergency attention. Even though service use has increased over 40% in recent years, research in this area is limited. The goals of this study are (1) to characterize adolescents who were admitted to an inpatient unit into transdiagnostic symptom profiles, and (2) to assess the relation among adolescents’ profiles and demographic and clinical information. Participants were 230 adolescents admitted to an acute, psychiatric hospital. Adolescents completed an electronic survey of demographic and psychological symptoms (i.e., depression, hopelessness, anxiety, trauma, irritability, and aggression) within the first 48 hours of admission. Data were analyzed using latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify subgroups or profiles of adolescents. Linear regression analyses were run to evaluate differences among subgroups and demographic information. Results from the LPA revealed a six-profile model: Irritable Depression, Dysphoric Depression, Irritability, Mild Depression, Irritable Traumatic Stress, and Traumatic Stress. These findings have several clinical and practical implications. Specifically, this research could aid in the understanding of types of adolescents on an inpatient unit, which could help inform psychological services offered during and after hospitalization to improve functioning, reduce symptoms, and decrease length of stay.",2021.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
132,M6922,10.1111/acer.14764,Dissociative symptomatology mediates the relation between posttraumatic stress disorder severity and alcohol-related problems,"Background: Up to 50% of individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) endorse problematic alcohol use. Typically, these individuals present with more complex and often more severe PTSD symptoms than those who do not report problematic alcohol use. Emerging literature suggests that heightened symptoms of dissociation are likewise associated with greater PTSD symptom severity. Despite this knowledge, the role of dissociation in the relation between PTSD severity and alcohol-related problems has yet to be examined. Here, we explore the mediating role of dissociative symptomatology on the association between PTSD severity and alcohol-related problems within a PTSD treatment-seeking sample. Methods: Structural equation modeling was used to test the mediating role of dissociative symptomatology between PTSD severity and alcohol-related problems. Participants N = 334; mean age (SD) = 44.29 (9.77), 50% female] were drawn from a clinical intake battery database for PTSD in-patient treatment services at Homewood Health Care, Guelph, ON, Canada. A subset of battery measures assessing PTSD severity, dissociative symptomatology, and alcohol-related problems were submitted to analysis. Results: A significant positive association emerged between PTSD severity and alcohol-related problems (β = 0.127, p < 0.05) in the absence of dissociative symptomatology. Critically, however, when added to this model, dissociative symptomatology (six unique facets of dissociation assessed by the Multiscale Dissociation Inventory) mediated the relation between PTSD severity and alcohol-related problems. Specifically, greater PTSD severity was associated with greater dissociative symptomatology (β = 0.566, p < 0.0001), which was in turn associated with greater alcohol-related problems (β = 0.184, p < 0.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that dissociative symptomatology plays a key role in explaining the relation between PTSD severity and alcohol-related problems. Future studies should examine the impact of targeting dissociative symptomatology specifically in treating individuals with PTSD who endorse alcohol-related problems.",2022.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
133,M6649,10.1371/journal.pone.0216541,"Maternal caregivers have confluence of altered cortisol, high reward-driven eating, and worse metabolic health","Animal models have shown that chronic stress increases cortisol, which contributes to overeating of highly palatable food, increased abdominal fat and lower cortisol reactivity. Few studies in humans have simultaneously examined these trajectories. We examined premenopausal women, either mothers of children with a diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder (n = 92) or mothers of neurotypical children (n = 91). At baseline and 2-years, we assessed hair cortisol, metabolic health, and reward-based eating. We compared groups cross-sectionally and prospectively, accounting for BMI change. Caregivers, relative to controls, had lower cumulative hair cortisol at each time point, with no decreases over time. Caregivers also had stable levels of poor metabolic functioning and greater reward-based eating across both time points, and evidenced increased abdominal fat prospectively (all ps <= .05), independent of change in BMI. This pattern of findings suggest that individuals under chronic stress, such as caregivers, would benefit from tailored interventions focusing on better regulation of stress and eating in tandem to prevent early onset of metabolic disease, regardless of weight status.

134,M10673,10.3389/fnins.2018.00228,Autonomic and brain morphological predictors of stress resilience,"Stressful life events are an important cause of psychopathology. Humans exposed to aversive or stressful experiences show considerable inter-individual heterogeneity in their responses. However, the majority does not develop stress-related psychiatric disorders. The dynamic processes encompassing positive and functional adaptation in the face of significant adversity have been broadly defined as resilience. Traditionally, the assessment of resilience has been confined to self-report measures, both within the general community and putative high-risk populations. Although this approach has value, it is highly susceptible to subjective bias and may not capture the dynamic nature of resilience, as underlying construct. Recognizing the obvious benefits of more objective measures of resilience, research in the field has just started investigating the predictive value of several potential biological markers. This review provides an overview of theoretical views and empirical evidence suggesting that individual differences in heart rate variability (HRV), a surrogate index of resting cardiac vagal outflow, may underlie different levels of resilience toward the development of stress-related psychiatric disorders. Following this line of thought, recent studies describing associations between regional brain morphometric characteristics and resting state vagally-mediated HRV are summarized. Existing studies suggest that the structural morphology of the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC), particularly its cortical thickness, is implicated in the expression of individual differences in HRV. These findings are discussed in light of emerging structural neuroimaging research, linking morphological characteristics of the ACC to psychological traits ascribed to a high-resilient profile and abnormal structural integrity of the ACC to the psychophysiological expression of stress-related mental health consequences. We conclude that a multidisciplinary approach integrating brain structural imaging with HRV monitoring could offer novel perspectives about brain-body pathways in resilience and adaptation to psychological stress.",2018.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objectives: The current study aimed at evaluating the effect of a health promotion lifestyle training program on the spouses of veterans with PTSD in Gorgan city, Iran. Patients and Methods: A total of 63 spouses of Iranian veterans with PTSD covered by the Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs in Gorgan were enrolled into this quasi-experimental study by the target-based sampling method. Subjects were assigned to 2 groups of experimental (n = 30) and control (n = 33). Eight 45-to 60-minute sessions of educational training were held for the experimental group within 8 weeks. Demographic data checklist and the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP) questionnaire were employed to collect data. Results: The mean total scores of health promotion lifestyle and subscales of physical activity, stress management, health care responsibility, and spiritual development significantly increased in the experimental group after the intervention (P  0.05). Conclusion: According to the results of the current study, educational interventions significantly improved lifestyle and health promotion behaviors in the spouses of veterans with PTSD. Hence, it is recommended to emphasize on training interventions as part of health promotion programs and improvement of lifestyle in care givers.",2018.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Participants (N = 721) were U.S. Air Force military medical personnel (61.4% male) deployed to Iraq between 2004 and 2011 who reported being either married or engaged. Most of the sample expressed at least some concern for mistreatment (79.0%), emotional abuse (70.8%), or physical abuse (66.3%) in their relationship. Caucasians were more likely to endorse emotional abuse concerns compared with other racial groups (p = .04). Men (p = .02) and service members who identified as Christians (p = .03) were more likely to endorse physical abuse concerns compared to their respective counterparts. Results suggest that relationship abuse concerns may be more common than expected among deployed military medical personnel. Demographic factors were associated with abuse concerns while military service characteristics and probable posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis were not associated with abuse concerns. Future research should examine abuse concerns in population-based studies of military personnel and evaluate the longitudinal trajectory of outcomes associated with relationship abuse among active duty military personnel across the deployment cycle. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study assessed the associations between PTSD symptom clusters and reactivity to cues in trauma-exposed adults with cocaine use disorder. Methods: We recorded electroencephalogram on 52 trauma-exposed participants (Mage = 51.3; SD = 7.0; 15.4 % women) diagnosed with cocaine use disorder while they viewed pleasant (i.e., erotic, romantic, sweet foods), unpleasant (i.e., mutilations, violence, accidents), neutral, and cocaine-related images. Reactivity was measured with the late positive potential (LPP), an indicator of motivational relevance. It was hypothesized that individuals with greater PTSD avoidance and negative alterations in cognition and mood (NACM) symptoms, as determined by the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), would have higher LPPs to cocaine-related images, indicating greater cue reactivity. Results: Linear mixed modeling indicated that higher NACM symptomatology was associated with higher LPPs to cocaine cues and higher arousal/reactivity was associated with lower LPPs to cocaine cues. Conclusions: These results highlight the potential clinical utility of the LPP in assessing drug cue reactivity in trauma-exposed adults with substance use disorder. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
138,M5972,10.1007/s00787-019-01382-w,"Metacognitive and motivation deficits, exposure to trauma, and high parental demands characterize adolescents with late-onset ADHD","The objective of this study is to evaluate support for three hypotheses about the etiology of adolescent-onset ADHD symptoms: (1) a “cool” cognitive load hypothesis, (2) a “hot” rewards processing hypothesis, and (3) a trauma exposure hypothesis. Participants (N = 50) were drawn from two public high schools in a culturally diverse metropolitan area. A detailed procedure for identifying and confirming late-onset ADHD cases is described. Adolescents with late-onset ADHD (n = 15) were identified and compared to childhood-onset (n = 17) and non-ADHD classmates (n = 18). Adolescents and parents completed measures of neurocognition, rewards’ processing, clinical profile, and environmental demands. Late-onset cases were clinically and neurocognitively indistinguishable from childhood-onset cases; however, they experienced higher demands from parents (d = 1.09). Compared to the non-ADHD group, late-onset cases showed significant deficits in metacognition (d = 1.25) and academic motivation (d = 0.80), as well as a pronounced history of multiple trauma exposure (OR 11.82). At 1-year follow-up, ADHD persisted in 67.7% of late-onset cases. Late-onset cases (26.7%) were more likely than childhood-onset cases (0.0%) to transfer to alternative schools by 1-year follow-up. Multiple factors may contribute to adolescent-onset ADHD. Adolescents with metacognition and motivation deficits may be at greatest risk for the late-onset ADHD phenotype, particularly in highly demanding environments. Exposure to traumatic stress may play a key role in the exacerbation of existing deficits or onset of new symptoms. Late-onset ADHD was persistent in most cases and associated with higher risk for school disengagement than childhood-onset ADHD. Further work is needed to better understand the etiologies of late-onset ADHD symptoms.",2020.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
139,M9622,10.4088/JCP.14m09229,Factors affecting exits from homelessness among persons with serious mental illness and substance use disorders,"Objective: We sought to understand the housing trajectories of homeless consumers with serious mental illness (SMI) and co-occurring substance use disorders (SUD) and to identify factors that best predicted achievement of independent housing. Method: Using administrative data, we identified homeless persons with SMI and SUD admitted to a residential rehabilitation program from December 2008 to November 2011. Our primary outcome measure was independent housing status. On a random sample (N = 36), we assessed a range of potential predictors of housing outcomes, including symptoms, cognition, and social/community supports. We used the Residential Time-Line Follow-Back (TLFB) Inventory to gather housing histories since exiting rehabilitation and to identify housing outcomes. We used Recursive Partitioning (RP) to identify variables that best differentiated participants by these outcomes. Results: We identified 3 housing trajectories: stable housing (n = 14), unstable housing (n = 15), and continuously engaged in housing services (n = 7). In RP analysis, 2 variables (Symbol Digit Modalities Test SDMT], a neurocognitive speed of processing measure, and Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale BASIS-24] Relationships subscale, which quantifies symptoms affecting relationships) were sufficient to capture information provided by 26 predictors to classify participants by housing outcome. Participants predicted to continuously engage in services had impaired processing speeds (SDMT score < 32.5). Among consumers with SDMT score ≥ 32.5, those predicted to achieve stable housing had fewer interpersonal symptoms (BASIS-24 Relationships subscale score < 0.81) than those predicted to have unstable housing. This model explains 57% of this sample's variability and 14% of this population's variability in housing outcomes. Conclusions: Because cognition and symptoms influencing relationships predicted housing outcomes for homeless adults with SMI and SUD, cognitive and social skills training may be useful for this population.",2015.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As young cancer survivors have a higher risk of developing psychological difficulties, this study investigated whether there were significant differences in psychological aspects between pregnant women who received a cancer diagnosis in the past and pregnant women without a history of cancer. A total of 123 pregnant women, of which 36 were cancer survivors and 87 women without a history of cancer, were recruited during their last trimester at different hospitals in Northern Italy. Patients were asked to complete a socio-demographic profile and questionnaires measuring mood states, post-traumatic symptoms, centrality of the pregnancy and cancer event, quality of life, and prenatal attachment. Cancer survivors had significantly higher levels of PTSD symptoms, perceived pregnancy as more central to their identity and life story, perceived lower quality of life and had lower intensity of prenatal attachment compared with the control group. Centrality of the cancer event did not correlate with any psychological variables.

Combining the regional homogeneity (ReHo) and seed-based functional connectivity analysis, this study investigated the regional and long-range neural synchronization abnormality during passive hyperthermia. We acquired the resting-state blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) data from twenty-three healthy male participants in two simulated thermal conditions: normothermic condition (NC) with temperature at 25°C for 1 h and hyperthermic condition (HC) with temperature at 50°C for 1 h. After scanning, participants were asked to perform an attention network test (ANT). Relative to NC participants, the participants in HC group exhibited decreased regional neural synchronization in the frontal-occipital cortex, specifically in the left opercular part of inferior frontal gyrus/insula, bilateral middle occipital gyrus, and posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, but increased one in the left dorsal superior/middle frontal gyrus. Using these significantly differed ReHo clusters as seeds, we further performed functional connectivity analysis and found aberrant long-range neural synchronization in the orbital medial frontal cortex, temporal-parietal junction areas. Further neurobehavioral correlation analysis showed significant positive correlation between the regional ReHo alteration in left dorsolateral superior/middle frontal gyrus and executive control effect. Additionally, the functional connectivity of the orbital medial frontal cortex with the seeds “left superior/middle frontal gyrus” and “posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus” were negatively correlated with the increase of rectal temperature. In current study, the participants showed hyperthermia-induced brain activity disruptions, appearing as altered local ReHo and long-range functional connectivity, which might help understand the relationship between neuronal and circuit activities and physiological thermal sensation and regulation as well as behavioral changes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",2018.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Participants included 876 students smokers between the ages of 18 and 24 enrolled at a four-year university or college. Results of the Latent Profile Analysis using the CSMSS revealed that five typologies of smokers were present in the sample. Three of these typologies were nondaily smokers: (1) stress/emotional regulation smokers, (2) low endorser smokers, and (3) nondependent smokers. The remaining two typologies, high endorser smokers and addiction/dependence smokers, were daily smokers. An LPA with covariates revealed that days smoked, purchasing patterns, and environment in which smoking occurs were all predictive of membership within the three nondaily smoker typologies. These constructs as well as cessation efficacy predicted membership between nondaily smoker typologies and daily smoker typologies. Lastly, an LPA with outcomes revealed that the nondaily smoker typologies differed from the daily smoker typologies on smoker identity, perceived stigma towards use, smoker image, secrecy of use, and perceived harm of current use. In general, the current study found that motives for smoking can differentiate between daily and nondaily smokers. However, the CSMSS was not as effective at distinguishing within the nondaily smoker typology. The current study also showed that nondaily smokers and daily smokers differed on both their smoking behaviors and their attitudes towards smoking. Future research should continue to investigate better methods of distinguishing within nondaily smoker and daily smoker typologies.

143,M8583,10.1002/2211-5463.12675,Altered expression of axon guidance related genes in the FKBP5 deficient mice,"Psychological stress is a risk factor for several diseases. In particular, stressor exposure has been linked with various psychiatric disorders. Since the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis plays a central role in the regulation of stress responses, it has been implicated in the etiology of stress related disorders such as PTSD. The HPA axis regulate synthesis and release of glucocorticoids and its dysregulation cause abnormal response to stress. FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP5) is a co chaperone of HSP90 in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) molecular complex and a key regulator of the sensitivity of GR. In this study, we profile the miRNAs in the prefrontal cortex of FKBP5 knockout mice compared to the wild type. Subsequently, we profiled target mRNAs for differentially expressed miRNAs in the FKBP5 deficient mice using several tools for sequence-based miRNA target prediction such as miRDB, DIANA tool, miRmap and TargetScan. Gene ontology analysis suggested that differentially expressed miRNAs in the brain of FKBP5 deficient mice may be involved in neuron development, cell motion, endocytosis, and cell-cell adhesion. The expression of predicted target genes was confirmed in the prefrontal cortex of FKBP5 mice using real-time PCR. As a result, we found that axon guidance related genes including Nfasc (neurofascin) were significantly decreased in the FKBP5 deficient mice brain. Nfasc is an L1 family immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecule which is important for neural cell migration and neurite outgrowth during development. It is also known that knockdown of Nfasc lead to reduction of synaptic transmission and impairment of synaptic plasticity, causing impairment of fear extinction. These results suggest that Nfasc could be a new target for understanding of the pathophysiology of PTSD.",2019.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All subjects underwent physical examination which included measurement of vital signs. Blood pressure was measured using Omron M6 device, central BP and PWV were determined by MobiloGraph. CV risk was calculated using Heart Score chart for high-risk countries. Results: Mean age was 53,40±6,95. 90,0% were active or former tobacco users, while 20,0% drank alcohol. Mean cholesterol level was 5,89±1,36; mean levels of LDL and triglycerides were 3,65±1,35 and 1,81±0,75 respectively. Body mass index mean was 28,25±4,02. 10,0% of all subjects had left ventricular hypertrophy. Mean value for Pulse Wave Velocity was 8,90±1,03. Average value measured in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 98,20±11,73. 30,0% had diabetes; 10,0% had coronary heart disease; 10,0% had previous myocardial infarction. Analysis showed 40,0% of PTSD veterans had hypertension, 20,0% had well controlled hypertension with pharmacotherapy while10% had uncontrolled but treated hypertension. 60,0% of PTSD military veterans had resting heart rate below 80/min, 10,0% had heart rate between 80 and 84/min and 30,0% had heart rate equal or higher than 85/min. Conclusions: There is limited data regarding cardiovascular risk in veterans with history of PTSD. A possible explanation for insufficient data is veterans' avoidance of Croatian healthcare system due to social stigma associated with PTSD. Veterans prefer to obtain support and assistance through various veterans' associations and religious organizations. Eliminating stigma around PTSD, its' early detection and appropriate treatment could improve registration of veterans with Croatian healthcare system and allow better understanding of their cardiovascular profile while ensuring optimal management of their cardiovascular risks.",2021.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Participants were 138 U.S. military service members and veterans (SMVs) prospectively enrolled in the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, 15-Year Longitudinal TBI study. Participants were classified into three groups: uncomplicated MTBI (n = 54), injured controls (IC, n = 26), and non-injured controls (NIC, n = 58). Participants completed the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory, PTSD Checklist, and Traumatic Brain Injury Quality of Life at baseline (.05). However, there was substantial variability in individual symptom trajectories over time. The majority of participants had symptom trajectories classified as either 'persistent' (∼32-55%) or 'asymptomatic' (∼30-36%), with a substantial minority classified as 'improved' (∼7-12%) or 'developed' (∼7-19%). Factors associated with 'persistent' PCD trajectories included cognitive complaints, PTSD, depression, anxiety, pain, and headaches at baseline; but not the presence/absence of MTBI. Factors associated with 'developed' PCD trajectories included PTSD and the number of lifetime exposures to blast. Conclusions: Reporting of 'new' PCSx over time was common in individuals with and without MTBI. It would be erroneous to assume uncritically that PCSx reported many years post-injury reflect only persistent symptomatology, or can be solely attributable to the direct consequences of a brain injury.",2020.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The participants were 123 victims of sexual abuse between 12 and 17 years (M = 14.13; SD = 1.75). The results of a cluster analysis show three groups of adolescents with high, moderate and low symptomatology respectively. The three groups showed statistically significant differences in gender, self-efficacy beliefs and perceived social support.

El objetivo del presente estudio fue identificar distintos perfiles de victimas adolescentes de acuerdo a su sintomatologia de estres postraumatico. Participaron 123 adolescentes victimas de abuso sexual de entre 12 y 17 anos (M = 14.13, DT = 1.75). Los resultados de un analisis de conglomerados arrojaron tres grupos de adolescentes con alta, moderada y baja sintomatologia. Los tres grupos mostraron diferencias estadisticamente significativas en funcion del genero, las creencias de autoeficacia y la percepcion de apoyo social. Asi mismo, se aprecian algunas tendencias que otorgan relevancia a la frecuencia de los abusos y a la relacion con el agresor. Estos resultados dan cuenta de perfiles diferenciados de victimas que pudieran servir para complejizar el debate asociado a las politicas en materia de infancia y para los programas de reparacion a lo largo del pais.

Surprisingly, preclinical studies examining how obesity disrupts the ability of the brain to cope with psychological trauma are lacking. The objective of this study was to determine whether an obesogenic Western-like high-fat diet (WD) predisposes rats to post-traumatic stress responsivity. Adolescent Lewis rats (postnatal day 28) were fed ad libitum for 8 weeks with either the experimental WD diet (41.4% kcal from fat) or the control diet (16.5% kcal from fat). We modeled psychological trauma by exposing young adult rats to a cat odor threat. The elevated plus maze and the open field test revealed increased psychological trauma-induced anxiety-like behaviors in the rats that consumed theWDwhen compared with control animals 1 week after undergoing traumatic stress (p<0.05). Magnetic resonance imaging showed significant hippocampal atrophy (20% reduction) and lateral ventricular enlargement (50% increase) in the animals fed the WD when compared with controls. These volumetric abnormalities were associated with behavioral indices of anxiety, increased leptin and FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) levels, and reduced hippocampal blood vessel density. We found asymmetric structural vulnerabilities to the WD, particularly the ventral and left hippocampus and lateral ventricle. This study highlights how WD consumption during adolescence impacts key substrates implicated in post-traumatic stress disorder. Understanding how consumption of a WD affects the developmental trajectories of the stress neurocircuitry is critical, as stress susceptibility imposes a marked vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders.",2016.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
148,M10590,10.1016/j.ynstr.2023.100569,Time-course analysis of frontal gene expression profiles in the rat model of posttraumatic stress disorder and a comparison with the conditioned fear model,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex disorder that involves physiological, emotional, and cognitive dysregulation that may occur after exposure to a life-threatening event. In contrast with the condition of learned fear with resilience to extinction, abnormal fear with impaired fear extinction and exaggeration are considered crucial factors for the pathological development of PTSD. The prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is considered a critical region of top-down control in fear regulation, which involves the modulation of fear expression and extinction. The pathological course of PTSD is usually chronic and persistent; a number of studies have indicated temporal progression in gene expression and phenotypes may be involved in PTSD pathology. In the current study, we use a well-established modified single-prolonged stress (SPS&FS) rat model to feature PTSD-like phenotypes and compared it with a footshock fear conditioning model (FS model); we collected the frontal tissue after extreme stress exposure or fear conditioning and extracted RNA for transcriptome-level gene sequencing. We compared the genetic profiling of the mPFC at early (<2 h after solely FS or SPS&FS exposure) and late (7 days after solely FS or SPS&FS exposure) stages in these two models. First, we identified temporal differences in the expressional patterns between these two models and found pathways such as protein synthesis factor eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (EIF2), transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-mediated oxidative stress response, and acute phase responding signaling enriched in the early stage in both models with significant p-values. Furthermore, in the late stage, the sirtuin signaling pathway was enriched in both models; other pathways such as STAT3, cAMP, lipid metabolism, Gα signaling, and increased fear were especially enriched in the late stage of the SPS&FS model. However, pathways such as VDR/RXR, GP6, and PPAR signaling were activated significantly in the FS model's late stage. Last, the network analysis revealed the temporal dynamics of psychological disorder, the endocrine system, and also genes related to increased fear in the two models. This study could help elucidate the genetic temporal alteration and stage-specific pathways in these two models, as well as a better understanding of the transcriptome-level differences between them. © 2023 The Authors",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LCA has been used for a wide array of psychological evaluations in humans, including the identification of depression subtypes or PTSD comorbidity patterns. However, it has never been used for the assessment of animal behavior. Our objective here is to identify behavioral profile-types of dogs using LCA. The LCA was performed on a C-BARQ behavioral questionnaire dataset from 57,454 participants representing over 350 pure breeds and mixed breed dogs. Two, three, and four class LCA models were developed using C-BARQ trait scores and environmental covariates. In our study, LCA is shown as an effective and flexible tool to classify behavioral assessments. By evaluating the traits that carry the strongest relevance, it was possible to define the basis of these grouping differences. Groupings can be ranked and used as levels for simplified comparisons of complex constructs, such as temperament, that could be further exploited in downstream applications such as genomic association analyses. We propose this approach will facilitate dissection of physiological and environmental factors associated with psychopathology in dogs, humans, and mammals in general.",2022.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the unequivocal medical benefits, living with an ICD may affect patients’ psychological functioning and general well-being. We examined the trajectories of symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety in patients with an ICD and the vulnerability factors associated with an increased risk of symptoms of PTSD and anxiety. Methods: A total of 249 patients were included as part of the WEB-based distress program for implantable CARdioverter dEfibrillator patients (WEBCARE) study. Data were analyzed using Latent class analyses, with trajectories of PTSD symptomatology and anxiety examined between baseline and 12 months follow-up. Results: The mean age of the sample was 58.9 ± 9.8, with the majority being male (82%). Latent Class analyses (LatentGOLD) revealed four classes with respect to PTSD symptomatology, and three classes of patients with respect to anxiety. Younger age, increased depression score at baseline, and Type D personality were all associated with increased vulnerability for posttraumatic stress and anxiety symptoms. Conclusion: Comparable trajectories were found for symptoms of PTSD and anxiety over time. Patients with a younger age, increased depression score at baseline, and Type D personality were especially prone to experience PTSD and anxiety symptomatology at 12 months follow-up. Due to the negative association between PTSD, anxiety, and health outcomes, it is paramount to timely identify the subset of patients who are vulnerable to experience these symptoms and provide them with personalized support.",2017.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The identification of distinct profiles of psychopathic traits is of practical importance as they help to distinguish between patients with distinct areas of risk and need. Methods: We used latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify distinct profiles of psychopathic traits in female (N = 357) and male (N = 483) civil psychiatric patients. Results: Three latent profiles were identified that appeared similar in women and in men. These profiles were termed Callous Aggressive, Antisocial, and Low psychopathic traits. A fourth profile identified in men was termed Moderate psychopathic traits. These profiles were distinguishable in terms of internalizing and externalizing behaviors, thoughts and attempts at self-harm, violence, and normal range personality traits. Extending current knowledge, we showed that equivalent profiles in women and in men were nonetheless distinguishable in terms of their associated psychological characteristics. Conclusions: Our results suggest that areas of risk and need vary between profiles of psychopathic traits, and that interventions should incorporate gender-specific features that account for between-gender variation.

152,M8511,10.26828/cannabis.2019.01.004,Alcohol and Marijuana Polysubstance Use: Comparison of PTSD Symptom Endorsement and Severity Patterns,"A growing body of work links posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and substance use. Unfortunately, much of the literature has examined associations in isolation (e.g., alcohol only). Failure to account for simultaneous or concurrent substance use may limit conclusions that can be drawn from existing research, including the extent to which specific substances contribute differentially to PTSD symptom patterns. The current study examined differences in PTSD symptom profiles between individuals using one or both of the most commonly co-administered psychoactive substances - alcohol and marijuana. Trauma-exposed participants (N = 533; M(age) = 21.15) comprised two mutually-exclusive groups: past-month alcohol-only use (n = 334) or past-month alcohol and marijuana use (n = 199). Cluster-level and symptom-level profile analyses evaluated mean differences and shape (parallelism) of PTSD symptom severity profiles between the groups. Follow-up analyses examined symptom-specific difference in PTSD symptom endorsement and severity. Overall, individuals using marijuana and alcohol evidenced greater PTSD negative cognition (30.8% greater) and hyperarousal (26.4% greater) symptom severity. Alcohol and marijuana users were more likely to endorse, and report greater severity of, mood-related PTSD negative cognition symptoms (e.g., anhedonia, negative affect) and externalizing hyperarousal symptom (e.g., irritability/aggression, risky behaviors) than alcohol-only users. Findings highlight important PTSD differences between individuals that are often lumped into homogenous categories of isolated substance users. Findings provide preliminary support for an 'additive' self-medication model between PTSD and polysubstance use. Lastly, findings indicate that mood-related negative cognition symptoms and externalizing hyperarousal symptoms may be important targets for PTSD-polysubstance use intervention.",2019.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
153,M4936,10.1002/jts.22598,Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Suicidal Ideation: The Moderating Effect of Posttraumatic Cognitions,"Although individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are at an increased risk for suicidal ideation (SI), it is unclear what factors might influence this association. Investigators have hypothesized that posttraumatic cognitions (PTCs), such as self-blame (SB) or negative cognitions about the self (NCAS) or world (NCAW), would play a role, but this has not been investigated empirically. Accordingly, we evaluated a model in which the association between PTSD symptoms and SI was moderated by PTCs in a sample of trauma-exposed undergraduate students (N = 410). To identify the specific source of this hypothesized moderation effect, we ran the moderation model separately for PTSD total severity, PTSD total severity without the cognition-related items, and each of four DSM PTSD symptom clusters in combination with each of three types of PTCs (i.e., NCAS, NCAW, SB), accounting for quadratic effects. The results revealed that NCAW moderated the positive association between all six of the PTSD variables and SI, f2s <.01 to.04. Analyses of simple slopes generally revealed strong positive associations between PTSD symptoms with SI at high levels of NCAW, no associations at moderate levels, and negative associations at low levels. We also found one statistically significant quadratic effect when examining avoidance and NCAW. In contrast, neither NCAS nor SB emerged as a significant moderator in any of our regression models. These findings highlight the importance of addressing PTCs—particularly NCAW—in trauma survivors. © 2020 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies.",2021.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A total of 612 Danish athletes (M = 18.99, SD = 4.29) from 18 different sports completed an online version of the Holistic Athlete Mental Health Survey that assessed well-being, depression, and anxiety together with potential risk and protective factors (e.g., injuries, stress, sleep, social support, sport environment). Results: Overall, 13.9% of athletes reported moderate or severe anxiety symptoms while 21.1% reported moderate or severe depressive symptoms. Female athletes had a significantly higher prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms and lower mental well-being scores than male athletes. Through a latent profile analysis, three distinctive mental health profiles (flourishing, moderate mental health, languishing) were discovered. MANOVA following Kruskal-Wallis tests revealed substantial differences between these profiles regarding their perception of social support, sport environment, and stressors from different life domains. Conclusions: Danish elite athletes display similar levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms as the Danish general population. Flourishing athletes report lower stress levels, receive higher support from the private and sport domain, and perceive their sport environment as more supportive than athletes who are languishing. A tailored approach is proposed to support athletes' mental health. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)",2021.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
155,M7190,10.1055/a-0594-8511,Substance Use Problems among Refugees and Migrants in Greece,"The refugee status increases the vulnerability of endangered people, exposed to pre-migration trauma and post-migration stress. The impact of migration stress is reflected in the development of mental disorders, especially post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression. The risk for psychoactive substance and alcohol use is consequently also increased. In Greece the confluent intersection of economic crisis and refugees' crisis contributes to a further enhancement of the risk. Refugees at the reception and identification centers are obliged to go through a long and complicated process and to wait for the uncertain result to their asylum application. The capacity of professionals of public health services is limited, overstrained and exceeded. There was an increase recorded in psychiatric referrals and emergencies. There's practically no existing, systematic investigation of substance use among refugees in Greece. Experience and information are very limited. Qualitative and empirical data from various carriers all agree on an enhancement of the phenomenon. The profile described is one of young, inactive, poor males, well informed on the available drug scenes in the area, many already using in their homeland, and alcohol, cannabis and opioids being the main substances of use. All official addiction services, prevention centers and non-governmental organizations have collaborated for the foundation of an interacting network in order to achieve psychosocial support, a smooth integration of children and adolescents and early detection of users. All substance users remain to be registered at reception and identification centers, an interinstitutional agency is to be engineered, psychiatric evaluation and treatment possibilities on site have to be introduced and referrals to specialized units need to become feasible. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

The present study investigated the implications of these differences for the classification of PTSD within a sample of German survivors of various traumatic events. Patients and Methods: A total of 341 trauma survivors who participated in a multicenter study were classified according to DSM-5 and ICD-11 and the results were compared. The PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) was used to diagnose PTSD. The ICD-11 PTSD cases were identified using a ""restrictive"" and a ""wide"" operationalization of re-experiencing symptoms (i. e. with and without intrusive memories). Depression and the level of trauma-related impairment were also assessed. Results: The diagnosis rate using ICD-11 was significantly lower than under DSM-5 (DSM-5 64.5%, ICD-11 54.0%, p < 0.001) using a restrictive operationalization of re-experiencing symptoms but differences disappeared when using a wide operationalization. Rates of comorbidity with depression were reduced under ICD-11. Individuals with high and low levels of trauma-related impairment were equally likely to receive a PTSD diagnosis under ICD-11. Discussion: Differences in the diagnosis rates between ICD-11 and DSM-5 depend on the operationalization of the specific ICD-11 re-experiencing requirements. Precise diagnostic guidelines are necessary to avoid inconsistent diagnoses.

Objective: To examine the trajectory of both post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression as well as the role of early counselling over 24 months among rape survivors. Method: The South African Rape Impact Cohort Evaluation (RICE) study enrolled women aged 16–40 years attending post-rape care services within 20 days of a rape incident (n = 734), and a comparison group (n = 786) was recruited from primary health care. Women were followed for 24 months; the main study outcomes were depression and PTSD. Reports of early supportive counselling by the exposed group were also included. The analysis included an adjusted joint mixed model with linear splines to account for correlated observations between the outcomes. Results: At 24 months, 45.2% of the rape-exposed women met the cut-off for depression and 32.7% for PTSD. This was significantly higher than levels found among the unexposed. Although a decline in depression and PTSD was seen at 3 months among the women who reported a rape, mean scores remained stable thereafter. At 24 months mean depression scores remained above the depression cut-off (17.1) while mean PTSD scores declined below the PTSD cut-off (14.5). Early counselling was not associated with the trajectory of either depression or PTSD scores over the two years in rape-exposed women with both depression and PTSD persisting regardless of early counselling.

Here we track veterans' trajectories from military service to homelessness through qualitative, semistructured interviews with 17 post-9/11-era veterans. Our objective was to examine how veterans become homeless-including the role of military and postmilitary experiences-and how they negotiate and attempt to resolve episodes of homelessness. We identify and report results in 5 key thematic areas: transitioning from military service to civilian life, relationships and employment, mental and behavioral health, lifetime poverty and adverse events, and use of veteran-specific services. We found that veterans predominantly see their homelessness as rooted in nonmilitary, situational factors such as unemployment and the breakup of relationships, despite very tangible ties between homelessness and combat sequelae that manifest themselves in clinical diagnoses such as posttraumatic stress disorder. Furthermore, although assistance provided by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and community-based organizations offer a powerful means for getting veterans rehoused, veterans also recount numerous difficulties in accessing and obtaining VA services and assistance. Based on this, we offer specific recommendations for more systematic and efficient measures to help engage veterans with VA services that can prevent or attenuate their homelessness.

However, the mechanisms underlying the role of psychological trauma in nsCLBP are less clear than in PTSD. Therefore, this study considered whether psychological trauma exposure (TE) is accompanied by specific alterations in pain perception. The study included 56 participants with nsCLBP and TE (nsCLBP-TE), 93 participants with nsCLBP without TE (nsCLBP-W-TE), and 31 pain-free controls. All participants underwent a thorough clinical evaluation. The standardized quantitative sensory testing protocol of the ""German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain"" was used to obtain comprehensive profiles on somatosensory functions in painful (back) and non-painful areas (hand). The protocol consisted of thermal and mechanical detection as well as pain thresholds, vibration thresholds, and pain sensitivity to sharp and blunt mechanical stimuli. Psychological trauma was validated by structured clinical interview. Trauma-associated symptom severity, anxiety, and depressive symptomatology were assessed by self-report questionnaires. Differences in somatosensory function were seen only for pressure pain thresholds. Compared with controls, nsCLBP-TE revealed hyperalgesia generalized in space with lower thresholds in painful and non-painful areas, whereas nsCLBP-W-TE demonstrated localized alterations with decreased thresholds only in the painaffected area of the back (P # 0.006). Our findings suggest an augmented central pain processing in nsCLBP-TE (alterations in painful and non-painful areas), whereas nsCLBP-W-TE show only local changes (alterations only in the painful area) suggesting regional sensitization processes. This finding might explain why TE without PTSD is associated with an increased prevalence of chronic pain. © 2015 International Association for the Study of Pain.",2015.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study we examined whether order of item presentation accounts for these findings. In a large sample (N = 1,311) of trauma-exposed undergraduates we conducted a series of confirmatory factor analyses using the PTSD Checklist and Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale, which present symptom items in the same order as DSM-IV, and the Detailed Assessment of Posttraumatic Stress, which presents items in a different order. Across all 3 measures the 3-factor DSM-IV model provided a relatively worse fit and the 5-factor dysphoric arousal model provided a relatively better fit compared with other tested models. We also examined the distinctiveness of 2 pairs of symptom clusters that appear in the dysphoric arousal model-avoidance versus numbing and dysphoric arousal versus anxious arousal-by comparing their patterns of associations with external correlates. Avoidance and numbing demonstrated differential associations with external correlates, as did dysphoric arousal and anxious arousal. Taken together, results indicate that order effects are unlikely to account for differences in relative fit between leading models of PTSD symptom structure. We discuss the need for future research in this area, especially studies designed to evaluate order effects more directly. © 2015 American Psychological Association.",2015.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A two-arm, pragmatic randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine the effects of both interventions on emotional distress, post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and post-traumatic growth (PTG) among cancer survivors and analyze attrition to treatment. Methods: Adult women with a range of cancer diagnoses were invited to participate if they experienced emotional distress at the end of their primary oncological treatment. Emotional distress, PTSS, and PTG were assessed at baseline, immediately after treatment, and 3 months after treatment. Intention-to-treat analyses were carried out using general linear mixed models to test the effect of the interventions overtime. Logistic regressions were performed to test differential adherence to treatment and retention to follow-up. Results: A total of 269 individuals participated. The observed treatment effect was significant in both modalities, PPC and OPPC. Emotional distress (b = -2.24, 95% confidence interval CI] = -3.15 to -1.33) and PTSS (b = -3.25, 95% CI = -4.97 to -1.53) decreased significantly over time, and PTG (b = 3.08, 95% CI = 0.38-5.78) increased significantly. Treatment gains were sustained across outcomes and over time. Analyses revealed no significant differences between modalities of treatment, after adjusting for baseline differences, finding that OPPC is as effective and engaging as PPC. Conclusions: The OPPC treatment was found to be effective and engaging for female cancer early survivors. These results open the door for psycho-oncology interventions via videoconference, which are likely to lead to greater accessibility and availability of psychotherapy.

Methods: ADSM meeting study criteria for self-reported PTSD (N = 470) were grouped according to EHR-PTSD diagnostic status. Participants completed PTSD symptom assessments over a 12 month period. We used log binomial regression and linear mixed model to examine predictors of receiving an EHR-PTSD diagnosis and to analyze healthcare utilization and symptom trajectories based on diagnostic status. Results: Thirty percent of ADSM with study-identified PTSD had an EHR-PTSD diagnosis. Combat exposure and PTSD severity predicted EHR-PTSD diagnosis. ADSM without the diagnosis were more likely to have an adjustment disorder diagnosis. Participants with an EHR-PTSD diagnosis utilized more healthcare and reported worse PTSD symptoms over 12 months. Conclusions: Findings suggest providers are more likely to record PTSD diagnoses for more severe, complex cases.

The aim of the study was to examine EF factors in a mixed clinical cohort (Autism Spectrum Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder) characterised by social impairment and investigate the influence of trait anxiety and state-based depression, anxiety and stress. Methods: In Study 1, a factor analysis identified EF and non-EF latent factor structures (N = 205). In Study 2, (N = 137) multiple regression analyses investigated the association between trait anxiety and state based depression, anxiety and stress, on EF and non-EF cognitive domains and on the two composite indices of the Behavioural Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). Results: Trait anxiety was associated with better performance on neuropsychological measures of EF while state-based stress was associated with lower EF performance. A dissociation was observed between trait anxiety and state stress on the two behavioural indices of the BRIEF. Depression, anxiety and stress did not predict performance on non-EF cognitive domains. Limitations: The cross-sectional design precludes cause-effect conclusions, further only self-report measures of affect were utilised and our performance measures of EF did not include a working memory test. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that trait anxiety and state-based stress influence EF processes across disorders with social impairment. The transdiagnostic efficacy of this finding can facilitate remediation strategies, it may also contribute to individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder gaining better access to mental health services.

Using single-case analytic strategies, including multiple-baseline design and modeling techniques, the authors treated 8 adolescents with emotional disorder diagnoses and evaluated trajectories of change in distress tolerance and experiential avoidance as well as in the sequencing of such change in regard to change in anxiety and depressive symptoms. Clinical outcomes were favorable based on parent, adolescent, and clinician-rated measures. Treatment-based change was demonstrated, at both group and individual levels, and at expected points in treatment, in regard to facets of neuroticism. Overall, self-reported change in experiential avoidance and distress tolerance tended to occur simultaneously to reductions in emotional disorder symptoms. This study helps to clarify the course of expected change in variables believed to be common among a range of emotional disorders during a transdiagnostic treatment and provides initial information regarding tailoring the UP-A for individuals with different clinical profiles.

165,M8312,10.1159/000438780,Psychological factors that characterize PTSD and depression in high school students affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake,"Introduction: We examined which psychological factors characterize Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and depression in students affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake. Specifically, we examined automatic thoughts, negative appraisals of post-traumatic stress symptoms, and post-traumatic growth. Methods: We administered an inventory assessing these factors to 289 high school students (139 boys and 150 girls) of Iwate Prefecture who had been affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake. We then performed a discriminant analysis to examine which patterns of these factors predicted PTSD and depression. Results: Fifty-eight students showed high PTSD levels greater than the cut-off of 19. Similarly, 63 students exhibited severe depression levels higher than the cut-off (> 16 points). Both the PTSD and depression scores were significantly higher than normal levels. Our results suggested that negative appraisals of post-traumatic stress symptoms and post-traumatic growth predicted PTSD, while automatic thoughts and post-traumatic growth predicted depression. Conclusions: The present results can inform the development of preventive approaches; for example, cognitive restructuring would be useful for decreasing students' negative appraisals of their post-traumatic stress symptoms and increasing post-traumatic growth, which would facilitate their recovery from disaster traumas and reduce the likelihood of their developing PTSD.",2015.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
166,M7891,10.1016/j.neunet.2020.12.005,Deep multi-kernel auto-encoder network for clustering brain functional connectivity data,"In this study, we propose a deep-learning network model called the deep multi-kernel auto-encoder clustering network (DMACN) for clustering functional connectivity data for brain diseases. This model is an end-to-end clustering algorithm that can learn potentially advanced features and cluster disease categories. Unlike other auto-encoders, DMACN has an added self-expression layer and standard back-propagation is used to learn the features that are beneficial for clustering brain functional connectivity data. In the self-expression layer, the kernel matrix is constructed to extract effective features and a new loss function is proposed to constrain the clustering portion, which enables the training of a deep neural learning network that tends to cluster. To test the performance of the proposed algorithm, we applied the end-to-end deep unsupervised clustering algorithm to brain connectivity data. We then conducted experiments based on four public brain functional connectivity data sets and our own functional connectivity data set. The DMACN algorithm yielded good results in various evaluations compared with the existing clustering algorithm for brain functional connectivity data, the deep auto-encoder clustering algorithm, and several other relevant clustering algorithms. The deep-learning-based clustering algorithm has great potential for use in the unsupervised recognition of brain diseases.",2021.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the aim to address experimentally a model of conduct disorder, we investigated the male offspring of individual mouse dams characterized by high basal plasma corticosterone concentration (HC trait). Notably, classification indices correlated selectively in these females with quite poor maternal care devoted to their offspring. Contrary to their HC mothers, adult male offspring exhibited an integrated profile of dampened physiological reactivity to external stressors co-occurring poor sociability/emotional contagion, impaired punishment-induced memory, and exacerbated aggression. A significant reduction of glucocorticoid and opioid mu receptors' expression in frontal cortex of model HC offspring was also evidenced. Moreover, in the absence of changes in oxytocin receptor in behaviorally-relevant neural areas, we showed that intranasal oxytocin administration (0 or 20.0 microg/kg) selectively modulated specific components of the behavioral phenotype. Ultimately, current data support the notion that maternally-inoculated environmental stress early in development may represent a critical risk factor in disturbances characterised by abnormal aggression and excess callousness.

Compared to the general responders program, the WTC EHC is diverse with equal gender distribution, representation of many races and ethnicities, and a wide range of social economic status. Patients in the WTC EHC were initially enrolled for physical symptoms, most of which were respiratory, however a large portion of the enrollees scored positive for probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this paper we identify patient characteristics associated with probable PTSD. We also determine the characteristics associated with the longitudinal change of PTSD symptoms, including persistence and remittance, using the widely used Posttraumatic Check List-17 (PCL) cut-off value of 44, as well as changes in PCL total score and symptom cluster scores in patients of Low and High PTSD symptom severity. Few patients with elevated scores achieved a score below 44. However, longitudinal improvement in PCL score at follow-up was identified for patients with High PTSD scores (PCL > 57.5). Changes in PCL symptom clusters differed between those with High and Low PCL scores. These data suggest improvement over time in PCL score that differs depending on the severity of the score and variable responses in the PCL symptom clusters.",2019.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
169,M8828,10.1007/s00127-018-1597-8,"Quality not quantity: loneliness subtypes, psychological trauma, and mental health in the US adult population","PURPOSE: Loneliness is a recognised public-health concern that is traditionally regarded as a unidimensional construct. Theories of loneliness predict the existence of subtypes of loneliness. In this study, latent class analysis (LCA) was used to test for the presence of loneliness subtypes and to examine their association with multiple mental health variables. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of US adults (N = 1839) completed the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, along with self-report measures of childhood and adulthood trauma, psychological wellbeing, major depression, and generalized anxiety. RESULTS: When treated as a unidimensional construct, 17.1% of US adults aged 18-70 were classified as lonely. However, the LCA results identified four loneliness classes which varied quantitatively and qualitatively: 'low' (52.8%), 'social' (8.2%), 'emotional' (26.6%), and 'social and emotional' (12.4%) loneliness. The 'social and emotional' class were characterised by the highest levels of psychological distress, followed by the 'emotional' class. The 'social' loneliness class had similar mental health scores as the 'low' loneliness class. Childhood and adulthood trauma were independently related to the most distressed loneliness classes. CONCLUSIONS: Current findings provide support for the presence of subtypes of loneliness and show that they have unique associations with mental health status. Recognition of these subtypes of loneliness revealed that the number of US adults aged 18-70 experiencing loneliness was twice as high as what was estimated when loneliness was conceptualized as a unidimensional construct. The perceived quality, not the quantity, of interpersonal connections was associated with poor mental health.",2019.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
170,M6854,10.1111/ajo.13067,Identifying prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in pregnant women after a previous emergency caesarean section,"Introduction: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and PTSD symptoms among women in pregnancy and after birth are common and under recognized. This study characterized the prevalence of PTSD symptoms and associated risk factors among pregnant women who have had previous emergency caesarean section (EmCS) and were seen at the Vaginal Birth After Caesarean (VBAC) clinic in a regional hospital. Methods: The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) assessed the prevalence of PTSD symptoms in 65 pregnant women (after power calculations) who had experienced previous EmCS. Women were screened prior to their appointment. A 10-question survey determined demographic data and medical history to ascertain potential risk factors. The relationship between symptom prevalence and demographic data was assessed using linear regression. Results: 3 of 64 (4.6%) participants met the PCL-5 cut-off score of 33 for a provisional PTSD diagnosis. 12 of 64 (18.75%) participants had PCL-5 scores greater or equal to 15. Women who had a mental health diagnosis, history of sexual assault and women who were born outside of Australia were more likely to report higher levels of PTSD symptoms. Women reported a higher number of Cluster D symptoms including negative beliefs about the stressful event. Discussion: This study highlights the prevalence of PTSD symptoms and risk factors in pregnant women post-EmCS. We need to start screening women alongside existing postnatal depression screening and consider high-risk groups.

171,M6732,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2021.105190,The role of stress reactivity and pre-injury psychosocial vulnerability to psychological and physical health immediately after traumatic injury,"Background: Traumatic injuries can have long-term negative impacts on health, especially psychological health. A biopsychosocial approach is recommended to identify those likely to experience psychosocial stress, however large individual differences exist in stress reactivity and post-injury health that remain unexplored. Therefore, we investigated autonomic nervous system (ANS) stress responses and pre-existing psychosocial vulnerability as contributors to health in individuals who sustained a traffic-related injury. Methods: 120 adults with traffic-related injury and 112 non-injury controls underwent an integrative ANS (cardiac and skin conductance) assessment and a health-related assessment at 3-6 weeks post-injury. Propensity score matching based on six pre-injury psychosocial vulnerability factors (age, sex, education, prior mental/physical health, socioeconomic status) guided the definition of high vulnerability (HV) and low vulnerability (LV) injury subgroups, with the LV subgroup having similar propensity scores to non-injury controls. A three-group comparative analysis of ANS responsivity (baseline, reactivity, recovery/rebound) and post-injury health was performed. Results: The HV subgroup exhibited the most negative immediate post-injury mental health profile and less adaptive ANS response patterns, indicating greater stress vulnerability/reactivity. Significant differences were found for psychological health (elevated psychological distress and catastrophizing), but not physical health (injury factors, pain, fatigue, physical wellbeing). HV participants showed sympathetic predominance at resting baseline (lower parasympathetic activity and/or elevated heart rate) compared to the LV and control groups, as well as smaller parasympathetic decrease during a cognitive task compared to controls. Despite preserved capacity for restoring initial homeostasis in both injury subgroups during recovery, there was some indication of blunted post-task sympathetic deactivation (larger sympathetic decrease) and reduced overall ANS adaptability (reduction in total power of heart rate variability spectrum), suggesting relative reduced capacity to face stressors compared to controls. Conclusions: Findings suggest that baseline resting ANS regulation, particularly parasympathetic activity, and pre-injury psychosocial factors are key contributors to individual psycho-biological responses following traumatic injury, and are therefore potential stress vulnerability markers. Post-stress recovery patterns may represent a novel physiological signature for a ""biological intrinsic"" vulnerability early after the injury. These findings provide direction for improved early identification and management of injured individuals, including innovative preventive interventions that target ANS regulation.

Method: Participants were community adolescents recruited as part of the European IMAGEN study. Bilateral amygdala regions of interest were used to assess the relationship between the three symptom domains and functional MRI neural reactivity during passive viewing of dynamic angry and neutral facial expressions. Exploratory functional connectivity and whole brain multiple regression approaches were used to analyze how the symptoms and psychosocial stress relate to other brain regions. Results: In response to the social-emotional stimuli, adolescents with high levels of conduct or hyperactivity/ inattention symptoms who had also experienced a greater number of stressful life events showed hyperactivity of the amygdala and several regions across the brain. This effect was not observed with emotional symptoms. A cluster in the mid cingulate was found to be common to both conduct problems and hyperactivity symptoms. Exploratory functional connectivity analyses suggested that amygdala precuneus connectivity is associated with hyperactivity/ inattention symptoms. Conclusions: The results link hyperactive amygdala responses and regions critical for top-down emotional processing with high levels of psychosocial stress in individuals with greater conduct and hyperactivity/inattention symptoms. This work highlights the importance of studying how psychosocial stress affects functional brain responses to social-emotional stimuli, particularly in adolescents with externalizing symptoms.

This study aimed to examine sex differences in PTSD symptoms based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5) using differential item functioning (DIF). Method: Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on the DSM-5 model of PTSD, followed by a multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) model to examine possible DIF using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5. Data were analyzed from a Malaysian adolescent sample (n = 481) of which 61.7% were female, with a mean age of 17.03 years. Results: The results indicated the presence of DIF for 2 of 20 PTSD criteria. Females scored significantly higher on emotional cue reactivity (B4), and males reported significantly higher rates of reckless or self-destructive behavior (E2) while statistically controlling for the latent variables in the model. However, the magnitude of these item-level differences was small. Conclusion: These findings indicate that despite the presence of DIF for 2 DSM-5 symptoms, this does not provide firm support for nonequivalence across sex.

174,M9740,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.12.005,Cell type-specific modifications of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and its type 1 receptor (CRF1) on startle behavior and sensorimotor gating,"The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family of peptides and receptors coordinates the mammalian endocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses to stress. Excessive CRF production has been implicated in the etiology of stress-sensitive psychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is associated with alterations in startle plasticity. The CRF family of peptides and receptors mediate acute startle response changes during stress, and chronic CRF activation can induce startle abnormalities. To determine what neural circuits modulate startle in response to chronic CRF activation, transgenic mice overexpressing CRF throughout the central nervous system (CNS; CRF-COECNS) or restricted to inhibitory GABAergic neurons (CRF-COEGABA) were compared across multiple domains of startle plasticity. CRF overexpression throughout the CNS increased startle magnitude and reduced ability to inhibit startle (decreased habituation and decreased prepulse inhibition (PPI)), similar to previous reports of exogenous effects of CRF. Conversely, CRF overexpression confined to inhibitory neurons decreased startle magnitude but had no effect on inhibitory measures. Acute CRF receptor 1 (CRF1) antagonist treatment attenuated only the effects on startle induced by CNS-specific CRF overexpression. Specific deletion of CRF1 receptors from forebrain principal neurons failed to alter the effects of exogenous CRF or stress on startle, suggesting that these CRF1 expressing neurons are not required for CRF-induced changes in startle behaviors. These data indicate that the effects of CRF activation on startle behavior utilize an extensive neural circuit that includes both forebrain and non-forebrain regions. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the neural source of increased CRF release determines the startle phenotype elicited. It is conceivable that this may explain why disorders characterized by increased CRF in cerebrospinal fluid (e.g. PTSD and major depressive disorder) have distinct symptom profiles in terms of startle reactivity. © 2014.",2015.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a cross-sectional self-report survey methodology, this study investigated trauma histories, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, and lifetime suicide attempts among forensic hospital patients adjudicated not guilty by reason of insanity ( n = 107). About 45 percent reported a previous suicide attempt and 22 percent reported multiple attempts, higher than the general population. The average number of attempts was 1.05 (2.39 among those with at least one attempt). The only PTSD symptoms significantly associated with attempting suicide were negative emotions and anhedonia, both in the cognitive/mood cluster, which was the only one of the four clusters to be significantly associated with attempting suicide. Childhood physical abuse was the only trauma significantly associated with attempting suicide. Higher number of attempts was significantly associated with ACEs (emotional neglect and abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect, and household members with substance-related problems), number of traumas, substance-related problems (especially from alcohol), arousal symptoms (excessive startle, inattention) and negative emotions.

However, no study has compared the effectiveness of these agents in routine clinical practice. We conducted a retrospective comparative effectiveness study of these 5 medications using electronic medical record data. Methods: We identified 2,931 Department of Veterans Affairs outpatients initiating treatment for PTSD between fiscal years 2004 and 2013 who received 1 of the 5 medications at an adequate dose and duration, combined with baseline and endpoint PTSD Checklist (PCL) measurements. Patients were identified based on clinical diagnoses of PTSD (DSM-IV criteria). We weighted participants in order to balance pretreatment characteristics. We compared continuous changes on total PCL score, symptom cluster scores, and sleep items, as well as categorical changes including reliable improvement and loss of PTSD diagnosis, using weighted regression analyses. We conducted exploratory analysis to determine whether any patient characteristics or service use variables predicted loss of PTSD diagnosis. Results: Patients improved by a mean of 5-6 points on the PCL over approximately 6 months of treatment. While half of patients had a reliable improvement of 5 points or more on the PCL, less than a fifth achieved loss of PTSD diagnosis. There were no differences between medications. The only significant (P < .001) predictor of loss of PTSD diagnosis was concurrent treatment with evidence-based psychotherapy. Conclusions: Available evidence-based medications for PTSD are equally effective in clinical practice. Although effective, our data suggest that patients choosing medication treatment for PTSD should consider concurrent treatment with evidence-based psychotherapy in order to maximize their chances of meaningful improvement.",2018.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research has shown that PTSS that emerged within days of trauma was a robust predictor of PTSD development. Aims To investigate patterns of early stress responses to trauma and their associations with development of PTSD. Method We recruited 247 civilian trauma survivors from a local hospital emergency department. The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and Acute Stress Disorder Scale (ASDS) were completed within 2 weeks after the traumatic event. Additionally, 3 months post-trauma 146 of these participants completed a PTSD diagnostic interview using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5. Results We first used latent profile analysis on four symptom clusters of the PCL-5 and the dissociation symptom cluster of the ASDS and determined that a four-profile model ('severe symptoms', 'moderate symptoms', 'mild symptoms', 'minimal symptoms') was optimal based on multiple fit indices. Gender was found to be predictive of profile membership. We then found a significant association between subgroup membership and PTSD diagnosis (χ2(3) = 11.85, P < 0.01, Cramer's V = 0.263). Post hoc analysis revealed that this association was driven by participants in the 'severe symptoms' profile, who had a greater likelihood of developing PTSD. Conclusions These findings fill the knowledge gap of identifying possible subgroups of individuals based on their PTSS severity during the early post-trauma period and investigating the relationship between subgroup membership and PTSD development, which have important implications for clinical practice.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objectives: To assess symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress among families of patients with COVID-19 during and after intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and to use qualitative methods to determine the sources of emotional distress. Methods: Families of patients with COVID-19 who participated in an ICU study were approached for participation in this post-hospital discharge study. Participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) at up to three points during the ICU stay and once after the ICU stay. Mixed-effects models were used to compare trajectories of HADS and IES-R scores over the ICU and post-ICU periods. Telephone interviews with participants were evaluated using thematic content analysis. Results: Among the 90 families that participated from September 2020 to April 2021, 47 respective patients were alive and 43 were deceased. Average HADS anxiety, HADS depression, and IES-R scores after hospital discharge were significantly higher (greater symptom burden) among families of deceased versus surviving patients: 9.2 (95% confidence interval CI], 7.8-10.6) versus 6.3 (95% CI, 4.9-7.6) (P < 0.01), 7.1 (95% CI, 5.7-8.6) versus 3.2 (95% CI, 2.3-4.1) (P < 0.001), and 36.1 (95% CI, 31.0-41.2) versus 20.4 (95% CI, 16.1-24.8) (P < 0.001), respectively. HADS anxiety and HADS depression scores began to diverge during the ICU stay, whereas IES-R scores diverged after the stay for families of surviving versus deceased patients. Qualitative analysis confirmed a higher burden of psychological symptoms among families of deceased patients. Memories from the ICU stay became a focal point for participants who lost their loved ones, whereas families of surviving patients were able to look positively toward the future. In addition, families of deceased patients often viewed friends and family as sources of stress, whereas families of surviving patients typically viewed their community as a source of support. Conclusions: Patient death was associated with symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder among families of ICU patients with COVID-19. Psychological support interventions may be most beneficial for families of patients who died of COVID-19. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04501445).",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
179,M8649,10.1177/0004867421998780,Cross-national differences in the prevalence of mental illness symptoms: Evidence against the vulnerability paradox,"Objectives: The vulnerability paradox refers to the observation that greater vulnerability is associated with higher prevalence of mental disorder at the individual level, but lower prevalence at the country level. The paradox is supported by studies estimating prevalence using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and by suicide mortality data. However, cross-national studies using single-item measures of subjective well-being find no evidence of a paradox, with vulnerability being associated with lower well-being at both the individual and country levels. These findings suggest the potential usefulness of simple indicators for studying cross-national differences. In this study, we investigated the vulnerability paradox using cross-national data on the prevalence of three symptoms that indicate depression or anxiety: unhappiness, sadness and worry. Methods: The data on prevalence of unhappiness were taken from 77 countries in the World Values Survey 2017-2020 and data on prevalence of sadness and worry from 142 countries in the Gallup World Poll in 2018. Country vulnerability was measured by the Vulnerability Index and gross domestic product per capita. The data were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis, with vulnerability measures as moderator variables. Results: For all three symptoms, prevalence was associated with higher Vulnerability Index and lower gross domestic product per capita. When both moderators were entered in meta-regressions, there were significant associations for the Vulnerability Index, but not for gross domestic product per capita. Conclusion: These findings are inconsistent with the vulnerability paradox. They underscore that reducing mental disorders should be a priority in poorer nations and that further economic and social development may be an important contributor to achieving this.

Youth may differ in the presence and severity of these underlying core features, and matching intervention strategies to such features may help personalize transdiagnostic interventions. We used latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify profiles of youth based on core underlying transdiagnostic dysfunctions and examined associations of profiles with treatment outcome. Method: LPA was conducted with 298 youth ages 7–18.8 (Mage = 12, SD = 3.2; 48.7% female; primarily White and Hispanic/Latinx) with a primary emotional disorder. Indicators for LPA included self-report measures of affect, anxiety sensitivity (AS), distress tolerance (DT), and emotion regulation (ER). Longitudinal associations between profile membership and treatment outcome were examined in a subset of 177 youth (Mage = 11.8, SD = 3.2; 52% female; primarily White and Hispanic/Latinx). Results: LPA identified three profiles characterized by differing levels of DT, affect, and ER. A Moderately Distressed and Dysregulated profile had the largest membership (65.1%) and poorer youth-reported anxiety and depression outcomes compared to a Distress Tolerant, Regulated Expressive profile (24.9%). A Distressed, High Affect Avoidant profile (10%) had the greatest baseline severity and the poorest depression outcomes, although most youth improved. Conclusions: Youth characterized by certain profiles of transdiagnostic core processes appear to have the poorest functioning and treatment prognosis, although most youth improved. Targeting these processes more directly and/or earlier in treatment may help to improve outcomes for youth",2022.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examined the prevalence of and temporal changes in CPD, its early and follow-up predictors and the extent to which it was predictive of mental health problems. Methods: The study took a two-wave design approach and was conducted during and 3–4 months after the nationwide lockdown in France. Baseline participants were 1123 (79.5% women; M age = 33.82; range: 18–80). They completed validated measures assessing CPD, posttraumatic stress (PTS), depression, and anxiety symptoms. Descriptive, correlational, and path model analyses were used. Findings: Both baseline and follow-up groups presented similar psychosocial profiles. Overall, 35.5% (95% Confidence Interval CI]: 32.7–38.4) baseline participants and 17.2% (95% CI: 12.6–22.7) follow-up participants developed clinical cases of CPD. The baseline CPD levels predicted 14–20% of the variances of PTS (b = 0.55), depression (b = 0.16) and anxiety symptoms (b = 0.16). After accounting for the effect of the baseline CPD levels, the current CPD levels predicted the three investigated mental health outcomes in high proportions (43–47%). Further findings revealed important temporal changes in baseline predictors of CPD. However, the chronic CPD and PTS symptoms were prevalent among students and individuals developing worries about the COVID-19 crisis while depression and anxiety symptoms were prevalent among single people and those with pre-existing mental health problems. Limitations: Data from self-report measures of mental health were used. The dropout rate between the two time assessments was relatively high. Conclusions: These longitudinal findings call for clinical efforts in assessment of and intervention in trauma-related distress. These efforts should be put into the predictive role of CPD in subsequent development of PTS symptoms and comorbidities as long as the health, social and economic consequences of the pandemic linger. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
183,M9720,10.3389/fncir.2021.784085,Temporally Targeted Interactions With Pathologic Oscillations as Therapeutical Targets in Epilepsy and Beyond,"Self-organized neuronal oscillations rely on precisely orchestrated ensemble activity in reverberating neuronal networks. Chronic, non-malignant disorders of the brain are often coupled to pathological neuronal activity patterns. In addition to the characteristic behavioral symptoms, these disturbances are giving rise to both transient and persistent changes of various brain rhythms. Increasing evidence support the causal role of these “oscillopathies” in the phenotypic emergence of the disease symptoms, identifying neuronal network oscillations as potential therapeutic targets. While the kinetics of pharmacological therapy is not suitable to compensate the disease related fine-scale disturbances of network oscillations, external biophysical modalities (e.g., electrical stimulation) can alter spike timing in a temporally precise manner. These perturbations can warp rhythmic oscillatory patterns via resonance or entrainment. Properly timed phasic stimuli can even switch between the stable states of networks acting as multistable oscillators, substantially changing the emergent oscillatory patterns. Novel transcranial electric stimulation (TES) approaches offer more reliable neuronal control by allowing higher intensities with tolerable side-effect profiles. This precise temporal steerability combined with the non- or minimally invasive nature of these novel TES interventions make them promising therapeutic candidates for functional disorders of the brain. Here we review the key experimental findings and theoretical background concerning various pathological aspects of neuronal network activity leading to the generation of epileptic seizures. The conceptual and practical state of the art of temporally targeted brain stimulation is discussed focusing on the prevention and early termination of epileptic seizures.

Research Method/Design: Qualitative descriptive study of 22 veterans who received care for TBI at a VA Medical Center in the Northeastern United States using directed content analysis. Measures included a semistructured interview, demographic survey, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Items (AUDIT-C), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), PTSD Checklist (PCL), Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Results: Results were organized according to Leventhal et al.'s (1997) illness perception model, including veterans' self-reports regarding: (a) knowledge of TBI, labels, and symptoms (identity); (b) etiology (cause); (c) the biopsychosocial impact of TBI (consequences); (d) symptom chronicity (timeline); and (e) recovery expectancy and management strategies (controllability). Participants identified common causes of TBI, as well as acute symptoms. Uncertainty was present with regard to TBI nomenclature, recovery expectancies and trajectories, and the impact of co-occurring mental health diagnoses. Conclusions/Implications: Opportunity exists to improve TBI-related education in the course of routine, patient-centered care. Clinicians should take into account the subjective beliefs and experiences, including co-occurring mental health conditions, that inform patients' illness representations to improve patient-provider communication and the quality of TBI care.",2018.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated for differences in psychosocial disadvantage, psychiatric disorders, and health service utilization amongst 194 general hospital patients referred to consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) with either no psychiatric diagnosis, single psychiatric diagnosis, multiple (non-SUD) psychiatric diagnoses, or one or more psychiatric diagnoses plus SUD comorbidity. The results revealed that SUDs were the commonest diagnostic category (34%). The SUD comorbidity group had the highest rates of disadvantaged housing, were prescribed the most psychoactive medications, and 20% prematurely self-discharged against medical advice. Increased SUDs were associated with reduced length of stay, men, younger age, increased investigations, and reduced private health insurance subscription. Patients with SUD comorbidity versus multiple psychiatric diagnoses had reduced odds of adjustment disorder, somatic symptom disorder, and insomnia disorder. Post-traumatic stress disorder was the strongest predictor of multiple SUDs, followed by cluster B personality disorders. In conclusion, SUDs have become a leading clinical focus for CLP. The presence or absence of SUDs amongst patients with multiple disorders has important implications for engagement in treatment, patterns of comorbidity, and prescribing practices.

We aim to further understand repeat sexual violence victimization to develop responsive and appropriate treatment for survivors of sexual violence. Methods: We present the immunological and contextual findings of a participant (N = 1) who experienced repeat sexual violence victimization during her enrollment in The THRIVE Study, a prospective case–control study of women aged 14–45 years, who have experienced recent consensual vaginal penetration (“controls”) or forced vaginal penetration (“cases”). Participants complete a survey, HIV/sexually transmitted infection, and pregnancy testing, blood sampling for C-reactive protein and adrenocorticotrophic hormone, collection of cervicovaginal fluid for immunological biomarkers, and self-collection of saliva samples for cortisol measurements, across study visits (Baseline, 1, and 3 months). Results: The case study participant, aged 18 years upon enrollment, experienced sexual trauma before four of five study visits. Trends in the mental health indicators demonstrate reciprocal fluctuations in adverse mental health and resilience in accordance with revictimization and circumstantial changes. Suppressed immune biomarkers appear to correlate with increased adverse mental health, while mental health recovery trends with immunological recovery. The participant presents with dysregulated hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis diurnal profile. Conclusions: This profile illustrates the intra-individual biobehavioral impact of experience with revictimization over the course of 6 months, capturing experiences that are rarely studied either longitudinally or with the depth of the current research. The findings underscore the value of monitoring cervicovaginal immune functioning and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysregulation in coordination with changes in mental health over the course of repeated sexual trauma.",2021.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A better understanding of metabolic responses in HS dairy cows is necessary to elucidate the physiological mechanisms of HS and offer a new perspective for future research. In this paper, we review the current knowledge of responses of body metabolism (lipid, carbohydrate, and protein), endocrine profiles, and bovine mammary epithelial cells during HS. Furthermore, we summarize the metabolomics and proteomics data that have revealed the metabolite profiles and differentially expressed proteins that are a feature of HS in dairy cows. Analysis of metabolic changes and “omics” data demonstrated that HS is characterized by reduced lipolysis, increased glycolysis, and catabolism of amino acids in dairy cows. Here, analysis of the impairment of immune function during HS and of the inflammation that arises after long-term HS might suggest new strategies to ameliorate the effects of HS in dairy production. © 2016, The Author(s).",2017.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method: Data were drawn from the Quebec Youths’ Romantic Relationships Survey, which involved a one-stage stratified cluster sampling of 34 Quebec high schools from Grades 10 to 12. A total of 8,194 youths (mean age = 15.35) were recruited. The survey assessed child sexual abuse, mental health problems (psychological distress, post-traumatic stress symptoms, suicidality), health services utilization, and health-risk behaviors (alcohol, drug, and cannabis use). Gender-stratified multivariate analyses were used to assess associations between child sexual abuse and mental health problems and health-risk behaviors while controlling for confounding demographic variables and other forms of child maltreatment experienced in childhood. Results: A total of 14.9% of girls and 3.9% of boys reported having experienced child sexual abuse. Child sexual abuse was independently associated with an increased risk of psychological distress, greater health services utilization, and increased health-risk behaviors, after controlling for other forms of childhood maltreatment experienced. Conclusions: Child sexual abuse is prevalent among youths in Quebec and is associated with an increased risk of a host of negative consequences. Continued efforts in the development of early detection strategies as well as prevention and intervention programs are warranted.",2019.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The field of Geriatric Psychiatry has advanced to the stage that it is increasingly recognized that distinct profiles of cognitive dysfunction and associated neurophysiological impairments play a significant role in the etiological bases, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of a broad range of disorders in late life, including late-life depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and posttraumatic stress disorder. We review the evidence in support of (1) the shared etiology of cognitive dysfunction and psychiatric disorders in late life, including neurodegenerative models of vascular function, white matter integrity, cortical thickness, and genetic risk factors; (2) the utility of cognitive dysfunction in distinguishing phenotypes of late-life psychiatric disorders; (3) the potential for late-life psychiatric symptoms to predict subsequent cognitive decline; (4) the potential for cognitive decline to predict emotional dysregulation and subsequent cognitive impairment and decline; (5) the severity of cognitive dysfunction as a predictor of pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic treatment response; and (6) the role of cognitive dysfunction in contributing to the negative association of medical disorders and mental health with age.

Neurocircuitry, immune system and hormone regulation differ from normal in adults reporting ACEs. These systems could be affected by epigenetic changes, including methylation of cytosine (5mC) in genomic DNA, activated by ACEs. Since 5mC levels influence gene expression and can be long-lasting, altered 5mC status at specific sites or throughout the genome is hypothesized to influence mental and physical outcomes after ACE(s). Human and animal studies support this, with animal models allowing experiments for attributing causality. Here we provide a lengthy introduction and background on 5mC and the impact of early life adversity. Objective: Next we address the issue of a mixture of cell types in saliva, the most accessible biospecimen for 5mC analysis. Typical human bio-specimens for 5mC analysis include saliva or buccal swabs, whole blood or types of blood cells, tumors and post-mortem brain. In children saliva is the most accessible biospecimen, but contains a mixture of keratinocytes and white blood cells, as do buccal swabs. Even in saliva from the same individual at different time points, cell composition may differ widely. Similar issues affect analysis in blood, where nucleated cells represent a wide array of white blood cell types. Unless variations in ratios of these cells between each sample are included in the analysis, results can be unreliable. Methods: Several different biochemical assays are available to test for site-specific methylation levels genome-wide, each producing different information, with high-density arrays being the easiest to use, and bisulfite whole genome sequencing the most comprehensive. We compare results from different assays and use high-throughput computational processing to deconvolve cell composition in saliva samples. Results: Here we present examples demonstrating the critical importance of determining the relative contribution of blood cells versus keratinocytes to the 5mC profile found in saliva. We further describe a strategy to perform a reference-based computational correction for cell composition, and therefore to identify differential methylation patterns due to experience, or for the diagnosis of phenotypes that correlate between traits, such as hormone levels, trauma status and various mental health outcomes. Conclusion: Specific sites that respond to adversity with altered methylation levels in either blood cells, keratinocytes or both can be identified by this rigorous approach, which will then be useful as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",2018.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the association between family separation and psychological symptoms in refugees resettled in Australia from 2013 to 2016. Participants were 1,495 adult refugees (M = 38.9 years, SD = 12.7) who participated in the Building a New Life in Australia population-based study across 4 years. Participants were assessed for psychological distress and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder-8 (PTSD-8), respectively. We used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to identify latent longitudinal trajectories and binary logistic regression to assess the contribution of family predictor variables toward PTSD-8 and K6 symptom trajectory class membership. The LCGA supported a four-class solution for PTSS, categorized as improving PTSS (18.4%), persistently high PTSS (11.5%), resilient PTSS (57.3%), and deteriorating PTSS (12.6%). For the K6, LCGA supported a four-class solution comprising classes categorized as persistently high psychological distress (PD; 7.0%), improving PD (17.3%), resilient PD (61.1%), and deteriorating PD (14.6%). Separation from family members did not independently predict the course of psychological symptoms; however, worry about family and friends contributed to the persistence of high PTSD-8 scores, OR = 1.75, and deteriorating K6 scores, OR = 1.57. The current findings suggest persistently high or worsening psychological symptom trajectories during the postsettlement phase may be marked by worry about family and friends, in addition to older age and female gender, rather than separation alone.",2020.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
192,M6613,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2019.12.001,The use of machine learning techniques in trauma-related disorders: A systematic review,"Establishing the diagnosis of trauma-related disorders such as Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) have always been a challenge in clinical practice and in academic research, due to clinical and biological heterogeneity. Machine learning (ML) techniques can be applied to improve classification of disorders, to predict outcomes or to determine person-specific treatment selection. We aim to review the existing literature on the use of machine learning techniques in the assessment of subjects with ASD or PTSD. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase and Web of Science for articles published in any language up to May 2019. We found 806 abstracts and included 49 studies in our review. Most of the included studies used multiple levels of biological data to predict risk factors or to identify early symptoms related to PTSD. Other studies used ML classification techniques to distinguish individuals with ASD or PTSD from other psychiatric disorder or from trauma-exposed and healthy controls. We also found studies that attempted to define outcome profiles using clustering techniques and studies that assessed the relationship among symptoms using network analysis. Finally, we proposed a quality assessment in this review, evaluating methodological and technical features on machine learning studies. We concluded that etiologic and clinical heterogeneity of ASD/PTSD patients is suitable to machine learning techniques and a major challenge for the future is to use it in clinical practice for the benefit of patients in an individual level.

Using data collected from military personnel in India (N = 146) and U.S. (N = 194), we examined (1) the best-fitting latent class solution; (2) multi-group invariance of the class solution; and (3) construct validity of optimal class solution. Results indicated that the optimal 4-class solution differed in severity and severity/type in the India and U.S. samples respectively. With similarity in the optimal number of classes across cultural samples, the meaning/nature of classes differed. In the India sample, anxiety severity predicted the Low Severity Class vs. all other classes, and the Moderately High Severity/High Severity Classes vs. the Moderately Low Severity Class; number of traumas predicted the High Severity Class vs. other classes; and resilience predicted the Moderately Low Severity Class vs. the Moderately High Severity Class. In the U.S. sample, alcohol use predicted the High Severity Class vs. all other classes, and the High Depression-Low PTSD Class vs. the Low Severity Class; rumination significantly predicted the High Severity and High Depression-Low PTSD Classes vs. each of the High PTSD-Low Depression and Low Severity Classes. Thus, meaning and nature of PTSD-depression subgroups may vary culturally; hence, culturally-sensitive interventions need to account for this heterogeneity.",2020.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
194,M6336,10.1002/brb3.1282,Emotion sensitivity and self-reported symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder across the lifespan: A population-based sample approach,"Background: Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) symptoms show deficits in emotion processing, but results of prior studies have been conflicting, and little is known about developmental trajectories of emotion processing over time. We examined the association between GAD symptoms and sensitivity to recognizing emotional facial expressions (emotion sensitivity: ES) for three emotions (happiness, anger, fear) in a large, diverse, population-based sample. We hypothesized that higher anxiety scores would be associated with poorer performance, and expected that ES performance and anxiety scores would decline across the lifespan. Method: Participants were 7,176 responders to a web-based ES study (age range = 10–96 years old). Results: Higher GAD-7 scores were associated with poorer ES performance for all emotion categories (happiness, anger, fear). The relationship between GAD-7 and ES scores remained significant after controlling for the effects of age and sex, and there was no significant interaction, indicating that the relationship does not change across age. Age significantly predicted ES and GAD-7 scores across emotions, with older ages showing lower ES scores and lower anxiety. Conclusions: In the largest study of its kind, GAD symptoms were associated with impaired ES performance across three emotion types. Future research should explore the connection between anxiety symptoms, cognitive processing, and social processing to better characterize the mechanisms of how GAD is linked with both social and non-social information processing. Future work may also look at if ES is related over time to changes in anxiety, making it a promising target for intervention.",2019.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Problem Management: Plus (PM+) is a five-session intervention designed for those impaired by psychological distress while living in communities affected by adversity. Individual PM+ has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing distress in Kenya and Pakistan, and a group version of PM+ (Group PM+) was effective for conflict-affected women in Pakistan. This paper describes a feasibility and acceptability trial of locally adapted Group PM+ for women and men in an earthquake-affected region of rural Nepal. Methods: In this feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial, participants in the experimental arm were offered five sessions of Group PM+ and participants in the control arm received enhanced usual care (EUC), which entailed brief psycho-education and providing referral options to primary care services with health workers trained in the mental health Gap Action Programme Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG). A mixed-methods design was used to assess the feasibility and acceptability of Group PM+. Feasibility was assessed with criteria including fidelity and retention of participants. Acceptability was assessed through in-depth interviews with participants, family members, programme staff and other stakeholders. The primary clinical outcome was depression symptoms assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) administered at baseline and 8-8.5 weeks post-baseline (i.e. after completion of Group PM+ or EUC). Results: We recruited 121 participants (83% women and 17% men), with equal allocation to the Group PM+ and EUC arms (1:1). Group PM+ was delivered over five 2.5-3 hour sessions by trained and supervised gender-matched local non-specialists, with an average attendance of four out of five sessions. The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrated feasibility and acceptability for non-specialists to deliver Group PM+. Though the study was not powered to assess for effectiveness, for all five key outcome measures, including the primary clinical outcome, the estimated mean improvement was larger in the Group PM+ arm than the EUC arm. Conclusion: The intervention and trial procedures were acceptable to participants, family members, and programme staff. The communities and participants found the intervention to be beneficial. Because feasibility and acceptability were established in this trial, a fully powered randomised controlled trial will be conducted for larger scale implementation to determine the effectiveness of the intervention in Nepal.

196,M9215,10.1037/abn0000307,"The social transmission of risk: Maternal stress physiology, synchronous parenting, and well-being mediate the effects of war exposure on child psychopathology","While chronic early stress increases child susceptibility to psychopathology, risk and resilience trajectories are shaped by maternal social influences whose role requires much further research in longitudinal studies. We examined the social transmission of risk by assessing paths leading from war-exposure to child symptoms as mediated by 3 sources of maternal social influence; stress physiology, synchronous parenting, and psychiatric disorder. Mothers and children living in a zone of continuous war were assessed in early childhood (1.5-5 years) and the current study revisited families in late (9-11years) childhood (N = 177; N = 101 war-exposed; N = 76 controls). At both time-points, maternal and child's salivary cortisol (SC), social behavior, and externalizing and internalizing symptoms were assessed. In late childhood, hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) were also measured and mother and child underwent psychiatric diagnosis. The social transmission model was tested against 2 alternative models; 1 proposing direct impact of war on children without maternal mediation, the other predicting late-childhood symptoms from early childhood variables, not change trajectories. Path analysis controlling for early childhood variables supported our conceptual model. Whereas maternal psychopathology was directly linked with child symptoms, defining direct mediation, the impact of maternal stress hormones was indirect and passed through stress contagion mechanisms involving coupling between maternal and child's HCC and SC. Similarly, maternal synchrony linked with child social engagement as the pathway to reduced symptomatology. Findings underscore the critical role of maternal stress physiology, attuned behavior, and well-being in shaping child psychopathology amid adversity and specify direct and indirect paths by which mothers stand between war and the child.

Determining the trajectory of recovery following COVID-19 hospitalization is critical for prioritizing care, allocating resources, facilitating prognosis, and informing rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate recovery following COVID-19 hospitalization. Methods: Participants age 18 years or older who were hospitalized for ≥24 h due to COVID-19 completed phone/video call virtual assessments (including the 10-time chair rise test) and survey forms at three time points (2–6, 12, and 18 weeks) after hospital discharge. Univariate logistic and linear regression models assessed the associations of the outcomes with primary predictors (categorical age, sex, race/ethnicity group, and categorical pre-hospitalization frailty) at baseline; the same were used to assess differences in change from week 2–6 (continuous outcomes) or outcome persistence/worsening (categorical) at last contact. Results: One hundred nine adults (age 53.0 standard deviation 13.1]; 53% female) participated including 43 (39%) age 60 or greater; 59% identified as an ethnic and/or racial minority. Over 18 weeks, the mean time to complete the 10-time chair rise test decreased (i.e., improved) by 6.0 s (95% CI: 4.1, 7.9 s; p < 0.001); this change did not differ by pre-hospital frailty, race/ethnicity group, or sex, but those age ≥ 60 had greater improvement. At weeks 2–6, 67% of participants reported a worse Clinical Frailty Scale category compared to their pre-hospitalization level, whereas 42% reported a worse frailty score at 18 weeks. Participants who did not return to pre-hospitalization levels were more likely to be female, younger, and report a pre-hospitalization category of ‘very fit’ or ‘well’. Conclusions: We found that functional performance improved from weeks 2–6 to 18 weeks of follow-up; that incident clinical frailty developed in some individuals following COVID-19; and that age, sex, race/ethnicity, and pre-hospitalization frailty status may impact recovery from COVID-19. Notably, individuals age 60 and older were more likely than those under age 45 years to return to their pre-hospitalization status and to make greater improvements in functional performance.

Epigenetic regulation of glucocorticoid pathway genes may be a potential underlying mechanism by which maternal conditions 'program' the fetal brain for downstream vulnerabilities. The present study aims to investigate whether mRNA expression of glucocorticoid pathway genes in the placenta predict offspring negative affect during early childhood (between 6 and 24 months). Participants include 318 mother-child dyads participating in a longitudinal birth cohort study. Placental mRNA expression of glucocorticoid pathway genes (HSD11B1, HSD11B2, NR3C1, NCOR2) were profiled and negative affect traits of the offspring were measured at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. HSD11B1 mRNA expression significantly predicted negative affect (beta = -.09, SE = .04; p = .036), and Distress to Limitations trajectories (beta = -.13, SE = .06; p = .016). NCOR2 mRNA expression significantly predicted Distress to Limitations (beta = .43, SE = .21; p = .047), and marginally predicted Sadness trajectories (beta = .39, SE = .21; p = .068). HSD11B2 and NR3C1 did not predict trajectories of Negative Affect or subscale scores. Infant negative affect traits were assessed via maternal self-report, and deviated from linearity across follow-up. mRNA expression of glucocorticoid pathway genes in the placenta may be a potentially novel tool for early identification of infants at greater risk for elevated negative affect. Further study is needed to validate the utility of mRNA expression of glucocorticoid pathway genes in the placenta. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",2020.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
200,M9193,,Aspects of common mental disorders in primary care,"Depression and anxiety disorders are common in the general population. Primary care is the first line of care for people with common mental disorders. This doctoral project investigated aspects of common mental disorders, including diagnostic procedures and interventions in primary care. Study I was an observational study of 480 people in the regions of Stockholm and Vastra Gotaland on sick leave for common mental disorders. It used structured psychiatric interviews (M.I.N.I.) and symptom severity scales (MADRS-S, KEDS) to investigate the relationship between sick leave certificate diagnoses for common mental disorders and diagnoses made in the psychiatric interviews. It also examined length of sick leave by diagnoses on certificates, interview diagnoses, and symptom severity. Many participants fulfilled the criteria for mental disorders other than the sick leave certificate diagnosis. For example, 76% on sick leave for stress-induced exhaustion disorder (SED) and 67% on sick leave for anxiety disorder fulfilled the criteria for depression (p=0.041). Diagnoses on certificates were not associated with sick leave length. Fulfilling SED criteria was associated with longer sick leave (144 vs. 84 days, p<0.001), as were more severe symptoms. Thus, sick leave certificate diagnoses do not reflect the diagnoses obtained in structured psychiatric interviews. This could mirror the changing and overlapping nature of the symptoms of common mental disorders and suggests that findings based on sick leave certificate diagnoses should be interpreted with caution. The association between longer sick leave and more severe symptoms or fulfilling SED criteria is clinically relevant and worth further study. Study II used data from the PRIM-CARE cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) at 23 primary care centers (11 intervention, 12 control) in Vastra Gotaland and Dalarna to compare the 12- and 24-month effectiveness of care managers to usual care for primary care patients with depression (n=376: 192 intervention, 184 control). Patients with care managers had less severe symptoms (MADRS-S, p=0.02) and higher quality of life (EQ-5D, p=0.01) at 12 months. Improvements in patients without care managers meant that this was no longer the case at 24 months (MADRS-S, p=0.83, EQ-5D, p=0.88). Responses to a study-specific postal questionnaire at 24 months showed that patients with care managers were more confident that they could get information (53% vs 38%; p=0.02) and professional emotional support (51% vs 40%; p=0.05). Care managers for primary care patients with depression therefore seem superior to usual care in the long term, as it took up to 24 months for patients without care managers to achieve the same improvements as patients with care managers achieved in 6 months and maintained long-term. Moreover, patients with care managers had more confidence in future care. Study III explored the views and experiences of general practitioners (GPs) who worked with the care managers in the PRIM-CARE study to better understand the GPs' perspectives on this organizational change. Transcripts from five focus-group discussions with GPs were analyzed with qualitative content analysis. GPs thought care managers could ensure care quality while freeing GPs from case management. They could also feel concern about role overlap, think that care managers should be assigned to patients who need them the most, and express the belief that transition to a chronic care model required change. In summary, GPs could see benefits to assigning care managers to patients with depression.

201,M9309,10.1016/j.jad.2023.02.046,Clinical significance of novel 8-factor model of DSM-5 PTSD in national VA PTSD residential treatment data: Internally- v. Externally-cued intrusions,"Background: Intrusion symptoms are a core defining feature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It was recently proposed that intrusions may be comprised of two distinct underlying processes: internally-cued intrusions (e.g., trauma-related memories), and externally-cued intrusions (e.g., reactivity to trauma-related cues in one's environment). This is the first study to examine the functional correlates of these two intrusion clusters. Methods: Participants included 7460 veterans discharged from 40 Veterans Affairs PTSD residential programs across the United States in fiscal years 2018 through 2020. Latent network modeling and structural equation modeling were used to assess the fit of an 8-factor model of PTSD symptoms, which were assessed using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) PTSD symptoms at admission, and its association with symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety, and emotional and physical functioning. Results: The 8-factor model, with separate intrusion factors, showed superior model fit to the DSM-5 4-factor, 5-factor dysphoric arousal, 6-factor anhedonia, and 7-factor hybrid models of PTSD. Internally-cued intrusions were uniquely associated with dysphoric arousal, decreased avoidance, and worse physical health functioning; whereas, externally-cued intrusions were uniquely associated with greater avoidance, anxious arousal, negative affect, increased generalized anxiety symptoms, and worse emotional functioning. Limitations: Limitations include the cross-sectional design and use of self-report measures. Conclusions: Findings provide initial support for the clinical utility of a novel 8-factor model of PCL-5 PTSD symptoms, which distinguishes internally- and externally-cued intrusions. These separate intrusion symptom clusters may offer greater specificity and utility in informing the prognosis of and tailored interventions for PTSD.

202,M9304,10.1016/j.addbeh.2023.107840,Comorbid psychiatric diagnoses and gaming preferences in US armed forces veterans receiving inpatient treatment for gambling disorder,"Armed Forces Veterans are uniquely vulnerable to problem gambling and gambling disorder. Even so, research regarding the full clinical profile of veterans with gambling problems lags. Gambling activities vary widely from each other, but most gambling activities can be understood as either strategic (i.e., involving some measure of skill and decision-making as a part of the gambling practice) or non-strategic (i.e., gambling activities that are entirely based on chance). Prior works have found that gamblers that prefer strategic gambling activities and those that prefer nonstrategic gambling activities often differ from each other in key ways, with the two preferences being linked to varying motivations for gambling, varying cognitions about gambling, and the course of gambling disorder. The present work sought to examine how preferences for strategic vs. nonstrategic gambling might be related to psychiatric comorbidities among U.S. Armed Forces Veterans receiving inpatient treatment for Gambling Disorder. Data from U.S. Armed Forces Veterans (N = 401) receiving residential treatment for GD between the years of 2010–2016 were analyzed. Results demonstrated that gamblers that preferred strategic gambling, as opposed to non-strategic gambling, were more likely to be younger, more likely to be men, less likely to have a nicotine use disorder, and less likely to have PTSD. Such findings suggest that gamblers with PTSD are likely to prefer nonstrategic games and may imply a unique vulnerability to gambling problems related to non-strategic gambling among armed forces veterans.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: This is a prospective observational cohort study of participants with symptomatic cyclic vomiting onset after chronic cannabis use. Standardized assessments were conducted to evaluate for lifetime and recent cannabis use, cannabis use disorder, and cannabis withdrawal symptoms. Quantitative whole-blood cannabinoid testing was performed at 2 times, first when symptomatic (ie, baseline) and at least 2 weeks after the ED visit when asymptomatic. The differences in cannabinoid concentrations were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic testing. The study was conducted from September 2021 to August 2022. Results: There was a difference observed between delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol metabolites, but not the parent compound during symptomatic episodes and asymptomatic periods. Most participants (84%) reported using cannabis > once per day (median 3 times per day on weekdays, 4 times per day on weekends). Hazardous cannabis use was universal among participants; the mean cannabis withdrawal discomfort score was 13, indicating clinically significant rates of cannabis withdrawal symptoms with cessation of use. Most participants (79%) previously tried to stop cannabis use, but a few (13%) of them had sought treatment. Conclusion: Patients presenting to the ED with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome have high cannabis use disorder scores. Further studies are needed to better understand the influence of THC metabolism and concentrations on symptomatic cyclic vomiting. © 2023 American College of Emergency Physicians",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
204,M6769,10.1016/j.jad.2022.09.097,"Network analysis of distress, suicidality, and resilience in a treatment seeking sample of first responders","Introduction: First responders are routinely and regularly exposed to traumatic events that can clinically manifest with a symptom constellation of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety, depression, and suicidality. Methods: We used network analysis to examine baseline data from treatment seeking first responders (n = 308) to examine the interrelatedness of those constructs, including a measure of resilience. We estimated two models: a regularized partial correlation network and a Bayesian Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Results: The models reveal converging evidence highlighting the central role of negative alterations in cognitions and mood PTSD cluster along with affective depression. These nodes did not significantly differ, though they were among the strongest in the partial correlation network and shared the most variance with the other nodes. The DAG results suggested that the negative alterations in cognitions and mood PTSD cluster predicted downstream constructs of affective depression; intrusion, hyperarousal, and avoidance PTSD clusters; and resilience. Only resilience and affective depression exhibited direct effects on suicidality. Both somatic depression and suicidality were endogenous endpoints in the DAG. Resilience exhibited an inverse path to suicide. However, resilience was relatively independent of the other constructs in the models and the DAG suggested that it was a consequence of PTSD related distress. Limitations: The data is cross-sectional in nature that should be followed up in longitudinal studies. Conclusion: Findings are discussed in respect to the role of distress and emotional dysregulation as common factors underlying a broad range of internalizing problems.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
205,M4929,10.1089/neu.2023.0009,Association between Insomnia and Mental Health and Neurocognitive Outcomes Following Traumatic Brain Injury,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To describe the association between five previously identified trajectories of insomnia (each defined by a distinct pattern of insomnia severity over 12 months following TBI) and trajectories of mental health and neurocognitive outcomes during the 12 months after TBI. METHODS: N=2,022 adults from the Federal Inter-agency Traumatic Brain Injury Repository (FITBIR) database and Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study. The following outcome measures were assessed serially at 2 weeks, and 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury: Insomnia Severity Index, Patient Health Questionnaire, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, PROMIS-PAIN, and Quality of Life After Brain Injury-Overall Scale. Neurocognitive performance was assessed at 2 weeks, 6 and 12 months using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales Processing Speed Index and the Trails Making Test Parts A and B. RESULTS: Greater insomnia severity was associated with greater abnormality in mental health, quality of life, and neuropsychological testing outcomes. The pattern of insomnia over time tracked the temporal pattern of all these outcomes for all but a very small number of participants. Notably, severe insomnia at 3 or 6 months post-TBI was a risk factor for poor recovery at 12 months post-injury. CONCLUSIONS: In this well-characterized sample of individuals with TBI, insomnia severity generally tracked severity of depression, pain, PTSD, quality of life, and neurocognitive outcomes over 12 months post-injury. More intensive sleep assessment is needed to elucidate the nature of these relationships and to help inform best strategies for intervention.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
206,M9288,10.1016/j.chiabu.2023.106033,Prospective effects of peer support and gender roles on the mental health and work functioning of child protection workers exposed to potentially traumatic events,"Background: Child protection workers (CPWs) are regularly exposed to potentially traumatic events (PTEs), especially, aggressive behaviors from the service users. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a peer support program on the mental health and work functioning of CPWs exposed to a PTE, while considering the moderating effect of gender roles. Participants and setting: Participants were recruited in two youth social services centers (YSS) in Canada and assessed one month (n = 176), two months (n = 168), six months (n = 162), and 12 months (n = 161) following exposure to a PTE. Three groups were formed: workers from the first YSS who received peer support (intervention group), workers from the first YSS who did not receive peer support (first control group), and workers from the second YSS where no peer support program was available (second control group). Methods: Linear mixed models were used to compare the three groups across time. Results: The intervention group did not differ from the control groups on any outcome variables at any time points. Gender roles did not moderate any effect. However, compared with the first control group, the intervention group scored lower on masculine gender roles, suggesting that lower masculinity may facilitate help seeking behaviors. Conclusion: The results point toward the need to improve the peer support intervention, to complement this intervention with other forms of support, and to promote organizational changes that would favor the workers' well-being and facilitate their recovery following a PTE.

As clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR-p) assessment and treatment becomes accessible to increasingly diverse populations, there is a need for clinicians to demonstrate greater clinical competency working with individuals across diverse social backgrounds and identities. Methods We examined rates of gender expansive (GE) patients seeking evaluation at an urban-based CHR-p clinic and compared the diagnostic profile of GE individuals to cisgender patients. Post-hoc analyses were conducted on clinical variables with significant differences between the cisgender and GE groups. Results The proportion of GE patients seeking evaluation increased from 2017 (9.3%) to 2021 (16.7%). Compared to cisgender youth, GE patients had significantly higher depressive, social anxiety, borderline personality disorder symptoms, higher levels of suicidality and non-suicidal self-injurious behaviour, and lower role functioning. Gender identity was predictive of suicidality controlling for social anxiety, borderline symptoms, and role functioning. Conclusions We review implications for CHR-p treatment and discuss ways to integrate minority stress theory and gender-affirming practices into coordinated specialty care for CHR-p patients.

208,M4935,10.1016/j.yebeh.2023.109331,Subjective seizure symptom reporting in functional/dissociative seizures and epilepsy: Effects of sampling technique and patient characteristics,"Background: Differences in subjectively reportable ictal experiences between epilepsy and functional/dissociative seizures (FDS) have received less attention than visible manifestations. Patients with FDS (pwFDS) tend to report seizure symptoms differently than patients with epilepsy (pwE). The effects of symptom elicitation method and mediation by psychopathological traits have not been examined and may aid in differentiating the disorders. Method: Analysis of responses of 24 pwE and 28 pwFDS in interviews exploring ictal experiences through open questioning followed by structured closed questioning using possible symptom prompts (74-item modified Psychosensory-Psychomotor Phenomena Interview, PPPI); self-report of psychological profile (HADS-A, HADS-D, PHQ-15, DES-T, THQ, PCL-C). Results: Symptom prompting with PPPI elicited three times more seizure symptoms than open questions in pwE (median 34 vs. 11.5, p = 0.005) and over four times more in pwFDS (42.5 vs. 11, p = 0.001). Intra-ictal symptoms were reported freely more frequently by pwE (median 6.5 vs. 4, p = 0.005), while pwFDS reported more pre-ictal symptoms after prompts (median 6 vs 14.5, p = 0.004). The difference between freely reported and PPPI-elicited symptoms correlated with different psychopathological traits in pwE and pwFDS. Symptoms of anxiety (HADS-A) correlated more strongly with prompted symptoms among pwE than pwFDS (z = 2.731, p = 0.006). Conclusion: Prompting generates more detailed ictal symptom profiles than simply encouraging patients to narrate their subjective seizure experiences. While pwFDS freely reported fewer symptoms related to the intra-ictal period compared to pwE, pwFDS reported more pre-ictal symptoms than pwE when prompted. Differences in the psychopathological traits associated with the number of peri-ictal symptoms captured by symptom prompting in pwE and pwFDS possibly reflect etiological or psychological differences between these patient groups.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, U.S. veterans are susceptible to exacerbation of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomology in late life. The aims of this study were to examine the extent to which older U.S. veterans experienced an exacerbation of PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify pre- and peri-pandemic factors that conferred risk for symptom exacerbation. Participants were U.S. military veterans aged 60 and older who completed three waves of the 2019–2022 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study (NHRVS) (n=1858). PTSD symptoms were measured at all waves using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, and a latent growth mixture model was conducted to compute latent slopes of change of PTSD symptoms over the 3-year period. 159 (8.3%) participants experienced a worsening of PTSD symptomology over the pandemic period. Factors related to PTSD exacerbation were incident trauma exposure between Waves 1 and 2, more medical conditions with onset prior to the pandemic, and peri-pandemic social restriction stress. Number of incident traumas moderated the relationship between both number of pre-pandemic medical conditions and pre-pandemic social connectedness, and exacerbated PTSD symptoms. These results suggest that the pandemic did not confer additional risk for PTSD exacerbation than would be expected over a 3-year period for older veterans. Those who experience incident trauma exposure should be monitored for symptom exacerbation.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the elevated risk of adverse mental health outcomes in response to exposure to morally injurious experiences in military members, it is critical to implement valid and reliable measures of MI in military populations. We evaluated the reliability, convergent, and discriminant validity, as well as the factor structure of the commonly used Moral Injury Events Scale (MIES) across two separate active duty and released Canadian Armed Forces samples. In Study 1, convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated through correlations between MIES scores and depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, anger, adverse childhood experiences, and combat experiences. Across studies, internal consistency reliability was high. However, dimensionality of the MIES remained unclear, and model fit was poor across active and released Canadian Armed Forces samples.

However, much of the research examining the impact of this caregiver involvement has focused on biological or relative caregivers, despite the high prevalence of trauma and trauma symptoms among youth in foster care and high rates of parenting stress among foster/adoptive caregivers. Objective: The current study examined differences among relative and foster/adoptive caregivers' levels of parenting stress throughout the course of TF-CBT and how these differences were associated with child trauma symptoms throughout treatment. Participants and setting: Participants were 130 caregiver-child dyads (84 = foster/adoptive; 46 = biological/relative) who completed TF-CBT in either an academic-based clinic or an associated mental health agency. Providing clinicians were trained in TF-CBT, participated in case consultation, and received ongoing clinical supervision. Methods: Children and caregivers completed baseline measures prior to beginning treatment and termination measures at the completion of treatment. Results: Prior to treatment, foster/adoptive caregivers reported greater dysfunction in their parent-child interactions and relative caregivers reported greater personal stress. These differences were not seen at treatment termination, and significant reductions in child trauma symptoms and caregiver parenting stress were evidenced from pre to post treatment. Significant covariation between child trauma symptoms and relative caregiver parenting stress at termination was also found. Conclusions: There were different profiles of parenting stress for relative versus foster/adoptive caregivers, but treatment completion attenuated group differences in parenting stress over the course of treatment. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
212,M9251,10.1017/S1355617722000108,Alzheimer's Disease Polygenic Scores Predict Changes in Episodic Memory and Executive Function Across 12 Years in Late Middle Age,"OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly heritable, and AD polygenic risk scores (AD-PRSs) have been derived from genome-wide association studies. However, the nature of genetic influences very early in the disease process is still not well known. Here we tested the hypothesis that an AD-PRSs would be associated with changes in episodic memory and executive function across late midlife in men who were cognitively unimpaired at their baseline midlife assessment.. METHOD: We examined 1168 men in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA) who were cognitively normal (CN) at their first of up to three assessments across 12 years (mean ages 56, 62, and 68). Latent growth models of episodic memory and executive function were based on 6-7 tests/subtests. AD-PRSs were based on Kunkle et al. (Nature Genetics, 51, 414-430, 2019), p < 5×10-8 threshold. RESULTS: AD-PRSs were correlated with linear slopes of change for both cognitive abilities. Men with higher AD-PRSs had steeper declines in both memory (r = -.19, 95% CI -.35, -.03]) and executive functioning (r = -.27, 95% CI -.49, -.05]). Associations appeared driven by a combination of APOE and non-APOE genetic influences. CONCLUSIONS: Memory is most characteristically impaired in AD, but executive functions are one of the first cognitive abilities to decline in midlife in normal aging. This study is among the first to demonstrate that this early decline also relates to AD genetic influences, even in men CN at baseline.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prospective long-term analysis in a Viennese cohort,"Background: Symptoms of mental stress are a hallmark of the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that just testing for COVID-19 could act as an effective stressor for persisting symptoms of mental distress including posttraumatic stress disorder. Our study aimed to determine whether personal beliefs on individual control and competence (locus of control, LoC) correlate with symptoms of mental distress and positive screening for post-traumatic stress disorder during a 9-month observational period. Methods: Between March and December 2021, we applied online versions of the Questionnaire on Competence and Control Expectations (FKK), the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Score (DASS), the Short Screening Scale for DSM-IV Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and a medical history questionnaire for COVID-19 symptoms (visit 1). 48 hours after negative COVID-19 testing, DASS was repeated to address relief effects on mental distress (visit 2). Following 90 days (visit 3), development of mental distress was addressed by a combination of DASS and PTSD, while the possible long-term manifestation of PTSD was evaluated 9 months later (visit 4). Results: At visit 1, 7.4 percent of the total sample (n = 867) demonstrated a positive screening for PTSD, while after nine months (at visit 4), 8.9 percent of the remaining sample (n = 204) had positive screening results. The mean age was 36.2 years; 60.8% were women, 39.2% men. In contrast to individuals with negative PTSD screening, these participants demonstrated a significantly different LoC personality profile. This was confirmed by the results of both DASS and the COVID-19 medical history questionnaire. Conclusion: Following testing for COVID-19, individuals with positive long-term PTSD screening present with significantly different personality traits than those w/o suggesting that self-confidence and effective control over one’s own actions serve as a protective function against mental distress.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Military missions are associated with an increased risk of depression. Understanding the long-term development of depressive symptoms after deployment is important to improve decision-making regarding deployment and mental health policies in the military. Therefore, this study aims to investigate trajectories of depressive symptoms from preto post-deployment and assess the role of specific factors, such as demographics, early life trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and deployment stressors, in the Dutch army. Methods. The study includes a cohort of 1032 military men and women deployed to Afghanistan between 2005 and 2008. From pre- to 10 years post-deployment (across 6 distinct time points), depressive and PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Symptom CheckList-90 (SCL-90) and the Self-Rating Inventory for PTSD (SRIP) respectively. Demographics, early trauma, and deployment experiences were collected at baseline and after deployment, respectively. Latent Class Growth Analysis was used to explore heterogeneity in developmental trajectories of depressive symptoms over time. Results. The study identified four trajectories for depressive symptoms: resilient (65%), intermediate-stable (20%), symptomatic-chronic (9%), and late-onset-increasing (6%). The late-onset-increasing group had the highest proportion of individuals younger than 21 years. In addition, the resilient group was less likely to have experienced deployment stressors and the symptomatic-chronic group reported more early life traumas compared to the other groups. For individuals classified in trajectories with higher levels of depressive symptoms, PTSD symptoms were higher at all time points. Conclusions. Multiple trajectories for depressive symptoms were identified in a military sample up to 10 years after deployment. These trajectories were associated with age, early trauma, deployment stressors and PTSD symptoms. The majority of the sample fell within the resilient trajectory, supporting the notion that deployed military personnel possess a high level of resilience. Overall, these findings provide valuable insights and a foundation for further research in this area.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the prevalence of comorbidity, the question of how PTSD and MDD are related and appropriate conceptual models for understanding their linkage in adolescence remains unclear. This study applies a multi-methodological approach to advance conceptual and theoretical understanding of the overlap between PTSD and MDD diagnoses/symptoms. We tested three methodological approaches with three distinct theoretical underpinnings on the structure of each disorder proposed in the literature: confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with dimensional constructs, latent class analysis (LCA) with person-based categorical constructs, and network analysis with symptom-to-symptom associations. Across the three different analytical approaches, there was a significant overlap between PTSD and MDD. Overall, there was no compelling evidence for distinct boundaries between disorders among trauma-exposed adolescents. Instead, we found considerable evidence that the typical latent-construct-based conceptualizations, whether categorical or dimensional, may need revision.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
216,M6794,10.1192/j.eurpsy.2023.249,Resilience of people with a history of mental disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic: a 2-years longitudinal prospective study,"Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, people with mental disorders were exposed to a common and prolonged source of stress. Studies focusing on the consequences of the pandemic on individuals with a history of mental disorder are scarce, but they suggest a higher vulnerability as compared to the general population. Objectives: We aimed at identifying predictors of stress resilience maintained over time among these people during the first two years of the pandemic. Methods: The presented study is part of a larger 2-year, 5-wave international longitudinal online survey. The Patient Health Questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale and the PTSD Checklist DSM-5 were used as latent class indicators for a proxy measure of distress. Specifically, a Latent- Class Analysis was performed to identify a group that showed resilient outcomes across all waves. We investigated socio-demographic characteristics, economic and housing status, lifestyle and habits, pandemic-related issues, and chronic disease. Adherence to and approval of the restrictions imposed, trust in governments and the scientific community during the pandemic were also assessed. Social support, fear of contamination and personal values were investigated respectively through the Oslo Social Support Scale, the Padua Inventory, and the Portrait Values Questionnaire. The aforementioned characteristics were used to predict sustained resilience through a logistic regression. Results: A total of 1711 participants out of the total sample (8011 participants from 13 different countries) reported a diagnosis of mental disorder before the pandemic. Nine hundred forty-three participants completed at least three of the five versions of the survey and were included in the analysis. A latent class of participants with resilience maintained over time (sustained resilience) was identified, with an estimated probability of 24.8%. The demographic and clinical variables associated with a higher chance of sustained resilience were older age, maintaining a job during the pandemic, and having a larger number of people in the household. In contrast, female gender, losing job during the pandemic, having difficulty meeting basic needs, greater fear of contamination, a stronger focus on hedonism, less social support and feeling lonely resulted in a lower likelihood of being sustained resilient. Conclusions: This study identified a number of factors that may help predict resilient outcomes maintained over time in people with mental disorders. COVID-19 related predictors of sustained resilience are new findings which might inform resilience-building interventions during pandemics.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
217,M6107,10.3389/fpubh.2023.1150121,Potential impact of metabolic syndrome on cognitive function in US firefighters,"Objectives: Among US firefighters, sudden cardiac arrest and psychological stress (i.e., PTSD) are the leading cause of on-duty death. Metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) may influence both cardiometabolic and cognitive health. Here, we examined differences in cardiometabolic disease risk factors, cognitive function, and physical fitness in US firefighters with vs. without MetSyn. Materials and methods: One hundred fourteen male firefighters, aged 20 to 60 years, participated in the study. US firefighters with MetSyn vs. non-MetSyn were divided by AHA/NHLBI criteria. Of them, we performed a paired-match analysis with respect to the age and BMI of firefighters with (n = 18) vs. without MetSyn (n = 18). The cardiometabolic disease risk factors included blood pressure, fasting glucose, blood lipid profiles HDL-C, triglyceride (TG)], and surrogate markers of insulin resistance TG/HDL-C, TG glucose index (TyG)]. The cognitive test included a psychomotor vigilance task as a measure of reaction time and a delayed-match-to-sample task (DMS) as a measure of memory, using the computer-based Psychological Experiment Building Language Version 2.0 program. The differences between MetSyn and non-MetSyn groups in US firefighters were analyzed using an independent t-test adjusted for age and BMI. In addition, Spearman correlation and stepwise multiple regression were conducted. Results: US firefighters with MetSyn exhibited severe insulin resistance estimated by TG/HDL-C and TyG (Cohen’s d > 0.8, all p  0.8, all p < 0.01). In stepwise linear regression, HDL-C predicted DMS total time (β = − 0.440, R2 = 0.194, p < 0.05), and TyG (β = 0.432, R2 = 0.186, p < 0.05) predicted DMS reaction time. Conclusion: US firefighters with vs. without MetSyn were predisposed to metabolic risk factors, surrogate markers of insulin resistance, and cognitive function, even when matched for age and BMI, and there was a negative association between metabolic characteristics and cognitive function in US firefighters. The findings of this study suggest that the prevention of MetSyn may be beneficial to supporting firefighters’ safety and occupational performance.

Some evidence has proposed that posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) can mediate this relationship. However, most data come from adult samples. This two-wave longitudinal study aimed to investigate the relationship between cumulative adversity (total amount of adverse and traumatic experiences), PTSS and somatization symptoms in adolescents. METHOD: The sample included 150 adolescents, mean age of 16 years old (M = 15.99, SD = 1.25) with 67 (44.7%) males and 83 (55.3%) females. All were exposed to at least one traumatic event or one childhood adversity. The interval time between the two assessments was about 1 year. RESULTS: The results showed that the PTSS Cluster E, alterations in arousal and reactivity, partially mediated the relationship between cumulative adversity and somatization symptoms (B = .09, BSE = .03, CI .01, .15]). However, the effect size of the mediation was medium, while the direct effect was large (B = .34, BSE = .08, CI .18, .50]). CONCLUSIONS: While arousal and reactivity symptoms seem to play a key role in adolescents suffering from somatization symptoms, cumulative adversity have their own direct and strong contribution. Clinicians should consider assessing PTSS and cumulative adversity when caring for adolescents suffering with somatic symptoms to better deliver intervention plans.

220,M10653,10.1055/s-0043-1761635,Knowledge Gaps in Placenta Accreta Spectrum,"Since its first description early in the 20th Century, placenta accreta and its variants have changed substantially in incidence, risk factor profile, clinical presentation, diagnosis and management. While systematic use of diagnostic tools and a multidisciplinary team care approach has begun to improve patient outcomes, the condition's pathophysiology, epidemiology, and best practices for diagnosis and management remain poorly understood. The use of large databases with broadly accepted terminology and diagnostic criteria should accelerate research in this area. Future work should focus on non-traditional phenotypes, such as those without placenta previa-preventive strategies, and long term medical and emotional support for patients facing this diagnosis. Key Points Placenta accreta spectrum research may be improved with standardized terminology and use of large databases. Placenta accreta prediction should move beyond ultrasound with the addition of biomarkers, and needs to extend to those without traditional risk factors. Future research should identify practices that can prevent future accreta development.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
221,M9224,10.1093/milmed/usab342,"Prevalence of Comorbidities in Active and Reserve Service Members Pre and Post Traumatic Brain Injury, 2017-2019","OBJECTIVE: To understand the prevalence of comorbidities associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients among active and reserve service members in the U.S. Military. METHODS: Active and reserve SMs diagnosed with an incident TBI from January 2017 to October 2019 were selected. Nineteen comorbidities associated with TBI as identified in the literature and by clinical subject matter experts were described in this article. Each patient's medical encounters were evaluated from 6 months before to 2 years following the initial TBI diagnoses date in the Military Data Repository, if data were available. Time-to-event analyses were conducted to assess the cumulative prevalence over time of each comorbidity to the incident TBI diagnosis. RESULTS: We identified 47,299 TBI patients, of which most were mild (88.8%), followed by moderate (10.5%), severe (0.5%), and of penetrating (0.2%) TBI severity. Two years from the initial TBI diagnoses, the top five comorbidities within our cohort were cognitive disorders (51.9%), sleep disorders (45.0%), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 36.0%), emotional disorders (22.7%), and anxiety disorders (22.6%) across severity groups. Cognitive, sleep, PTSD, and emotional disorders were the top comorbidities seen within each TBI severity group. Comorbidities increased pre-TBI to post-TBI; the more severe the TBI, the greater the prevalence of associated comorbidities. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of our TBI patients are afflicted with comorbidities, particularly post-TBI, indicating many have a complex profile. The military health system should continue tracking comorbidities associated with TBI within the U.S. Military and devise clinical practices that acknowledge the complexity of the TBI patient.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
222,M10658,,Measurement invariance of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms across three civilian trauma types,"The factor structure of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains the subject of intense investigation. The DSM three-factor conceptualization of PTSD has not been empirically supported; rather, two four-factor models of PTSD (King, Leskin, King, & Weathers, 1998; Simms, Watson, & Doebbeling, 2002) have garnered the majority of support from confirmatory factor analytic (CFA) studies. Recently, interest has turned to examination of the generalizability of these well-supported models across diverse samples. Termed factorial or measurement invariance, these studies answer the question of whether PTSD maintains the same factor structure, and can be measured equivalently, across samples. However, no studies have examined PTSD's measurement invariance across distinct, homogeneous samples exposed to different trauma types. The current study examined the factor structure and measurement invariance of PTSD in, and across, three groups of trauma-exposed college students (N = 854) using the PTSD Checklist-Specific Version (PCL-S; Weathers, Litz, Herman, Juska, & Keane, 1993). Participants were grouped according to self-reported direct exposure to one of three distinct trauma types: motor vehicle accidents (MVA), sexual assault (SA), and sudden unexpected death of a loved one (SUD). Five models were tested using within-groups CFA, and three models showed adequate fit in each trauma group (Elhai, Biehn, Armour, Klopper, Frueh, & Palmieri, 2011; King et al., 1998; Simms et al., 2002). Multiple-group CFA showed that factor loadings were equivalent across groups for the Elhai et al. (2011) and the King et al. (1998) models, but not for the Simms et al. (2002) model. However, intercepts differed between groups in all three models. These findings suggest that PTSD symptoms as measured by the PCL-S cannot be compared across individuals who have experienced different types of traumatic events, as observed scores on the PCL-S may not correspond to levels of the latent factors equivalently across trauma types. Implications and limitations of the current results are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
223,M6102,10.1016/j.schres.2023.05.003,Can computational models help elucidate the link between complex trauma and hallucinations?,"Recently, a number of predictive coding models have been proposed to account for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)'s symptomatology, including intrusions, flashbacks and hallucinations. These models were usually developed to account for traditional/type-1 PTSD. We here discuss whether these models also apply or can be translated to the case of complex/type-2 PTSD and childhood trauma (cPTSD). The distinction between PTSD and cPTSD is important because the disorders differ in terms of symptomatology and potential mechanisms, how they relate to developmental stages, but also in terms of illness trajectory and treatment. Models of complex trauma could give us insights on hallucinations in physiological/pathological conditions or more generally on the development of intrusive experiences across diagnostic classes. © 2023 The Authors",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
224,M10661,,An examination of sex differences in maladaptive shame coping styles in a military sample,"Shame plays a role in many mental health disorders. It is also linked to increased severity of suicidality in military and veteran populations. The Compass of Shame describes four maladaptive shame coping styles: attack others, withdrawal, attack self, and avoidance. The Military Compass of Shame Scale measures trait-shame in a military sample using military specific scenarios focusing on the four maladaptive shame coping styles. Sex differences in the expression of maladaptive shame coping styles were explored during the validation of the COSS but were not specifically focused on during the validation of the M-COSS. This research specifically focused on sex differences in maladaptive shame coping in US service members. Participants were from all branches and components of US military service. Results support previous civilian findings that military males and females differ in their maladaptive shame coping styles. Understanding how male and female service members differ in their maladaptive responses to shame might lead to using more appropriate treatment interventions, resulting in better treatment outcomes, a reduction of service members in both outpatient and inpatient settings, more efficient use of behavioral health resources, faster returns to service from a profile status, and a healthier mission-capable military force.

225,M4714,10.1037/trm0000456,Decreased Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms Following a Lucid Dream Healing Workshop,"Recent investigations of lucid dreams—dreams with a veridical awareness of dreaming—suggest that this unique form of dreaming may be useful for promoting healing due to the lucid dreamer’s capacity for goal-directed action in the dream. Following a prospective, within-participant research design, 49 adults experiencing chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were recruited to a 6-day online lucid dreaming healing workshop. The primary outcome was self-reported PTSD symptom severity, measured using the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.). Secondary outcomes included the degree of distress caused by nightmares, well-being, and positive and negative affect. The salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) biomarker was assessed as an exploratory measure in four participants. We observed that 76% of participants (n= 37) achieved at least one lucid dream during the workshop, and over half of those participants (n= 25) enacted a healing lucid dream plan as intended. Compared to baseline values, significant improvements were observed in self-reported PTSD symptom scores, nightmare distress, and well-being. A decrease in negative affect was also noted. sAA awakening response profiles for two participants enacting healing lucid dreams were consistent with a pattern of stress reduction, compared to two participants not enacting lucid dreams. Future studies are warranted that incorporate experimental conditions designed to distinguish effects unique to dream lucidity and to explore the mechanisms of action underlying health benefits experienced following healing lucid dreams. © 2023 American Psychological Association",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The final sample consisted of 513 community-based individuals and 288 inmates (total N = 801); all were administered the PAI and the IOP-29 in an honest or feigning conditions. Statistical analyses compared the average scores of each measure by symptom presentation and data source (i.e., community vs. forensic sample) and evaluated diagnostic efficiency statistics. Results suggest that the PAI Negative Impression Management scale and the IOP-29 are the most effective measures across all symptom presentations, whereas the PAI Malingering Index and Rogers Discriminant Function generated less optimal results, especially when considering feigned PTSD.

227,M4713,10.1503/jpn.220202,"Common and disorder-specific cortical thickness alterations in internalizing, externalizing and thought disorders during early adolescence: an Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study","Background: A growing body of neuroimaging studies has reported common neural abnormalities among mental disorders in adults. However, it is unclear whether the distinct disorder-specific mechanisms operate during adolescence despite the overlap among disorders. Methods: We studied a large cohort of more than 11 000 preadolescent (age 9–10 yr) children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development cohort. We adopted a regrouping approach to compare cortical thickness (CT) alterations and longitudinal changes between healthy controls (n = 4041) and externalizing (n = 1182), internalizing (n = 1959) and thought disorder (n = 347) groups. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed on regional CT across 4468 unrelated European youth. Results: Youth with externalizing or internalizing disorders exhibited increased regional CT compared with controls. Externalizing (p = 8 × 10−4, Cohen d = 0.10) and internalizing disorders (p = 2 × 10−3, Cohen d = 0.08) shared thicker CT in the left pars opercularis. The somatosensory and the primary auditory cortex were uniquely affected in externalizing disorders, whereas the primary motor cortex and higher-order visual association areas were uniquely affected in internalizing disorders. Only youth with externalizing disorders showed decelerated cortical thinning from age 10–12 years. The GWAS found 59 genome-wide significant associated genetic variants across these regions. Cortical thickness in common regions was associated with glutamatergic neurons, while internalizing-specific regional CT was associated with astrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and GABAergic neurons. Limitations: The sample size of the GWAS was relatively small. Conclusion: Our study provides strong evidence for the presence of specificity in CT, developmental trajectories and underlying genetic underpinnings among externalizing and internalizing disorders during early adolescence. Our results support the neurobiological validity of the regrouping approach that could supplement the use of a dimensional approach in future clinical practice.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Texas Youth Depression and Suicide Research Network (TX-YDSRN) Participant Registry Study was initiated in 2020 to develop predictive models for treatment outcomes in youth with depression and/or suicidality. This report presents the study rationale, design and baseline characteristics of the first 1000 participants. Methods: TX-YDSRN consists of the Network Hub (coordinating center), 12 medical school “Nodes” (manage/implement study), each with 1–5 primary care, inpatient, and/or outpatient Sub-Sites (recruitment, data collection). Participants are 8–20-year-olds who receive treatment or screen positive for depression and/or suicidality. Baseline data include mood and suicidality symptoms, associated comorbidities, treatment history, services used, and social determinants of health. Subsequent assessments occur every two months for 24 months. Results: Among 1000 participants, 68.7 % were 12–17 years, 24.6 % were ≥ 18 years, and 6.7 % were < 12. Overall, 36.8 % were non-Hispanic Caucasian, 73.4 % were female, and 79.9 % had a primary depressive disorder. Nearly half of the sample reported ≥1 suicide attempt, with rates similar in youth 12–17 years old (49.9 %) and those 18 years and older (45.5 %); 29.9 % of children <12 reported at least one suicide attempt. Depression and anxiety scores were in the moderate-severe range for all age groups (Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents PHQ-A]: 12.9 ± 6.4; Generalized Anxiety Disorder GAD-7]: 11.3 ± 5.9). Limitations: The sample includes youth who are receiving depression care at enrollment and may not be representative of non-diagnosed, non-treatment seeking youth. Conclusions: The TX-YDSRN is one of the largest prospective longitudinal cohort registries designed to develop predictive models for outcome trajectories based on disorder heterogeneity, social determinants of health, and treatment availability.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
229,M10672,10.1016/j.chiabu.2022.105995,"Elucidating the relations between adverse childhood experiences, age of exposure to adversity, and adult posttraumatic stress symptom severity in pregnant women","Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are typically assessed within two subscales: child maltreatment (CM) and household dysfunction (HD). More research is needed about how the CM and HD subscales differentially contribute to adult posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), accounting for additional adversities. Objective, participants, and setting: In a sample of 137 pregnant women exposed to recent intimate partner violence (IPV) in the United States, this study aimed to (1) explore the contributions of ACEs subscales to pregnant women's PTSS severity, (2) examine the inclusion of the witnessing IPV ACE in the CM subscale, and (3) contextualize the contributions of the ACEs subscales to women's PTSS by examining the moderating effect of age of first ACE exposure. Methods: The study used linear, multiple, and hierarchical regression analyses and the Hotelling-Williams test. Results: The CM subscale predicted pregnant women's PTSS significantly better than the HD subscale, controlling for past-year IPV (t(134) = 2.69, p =.008). Adding the witnessing IPV ACE to the CM subscale did not significantly improve the subscale's prediction of PTSS (ΔR2 = 0.07, p =.290). Age of first exposure did not significantly moderate the effects of the CM (β = 0.12, p =.140) or HD (β = −0.10, p =.238) ACEs subscales on PTSS. Conclusions: Results suggest that for pregnant women exposed to high levels of trauma, polyvictimization and particularly experiencing multiple types of CM have stronger predictive validity for PTSS than HD. Cumulative victimization may be more influential than age of exposure to adversity.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigates the associations between experiences and beliefs and PTSS among adolescent survivors of intermediate-risk HL treated on the Children's Oncology Group (COG) AHOD0031 study. Methods: COG AHOD0031 participants completed self-report surveys at end of therapy concerning post-treatment medical conditions, activity limitations, fatigue, future concerns, exercise, and PTSS. Results: One thousand one hundred ten of 1721 participants in AHOD0031 completed the first survey at a median of 6.7 months post-diagnosis (interquartile range: 5.3-11.5 months), and of these, 736 (66.3%) completed a second survey at a median of 12.4 (10.1-17.6) months following the first. The mean PTSS score (ranging from 0 to 20) was 5.5 (standard deviation SD] = 5.1) on survey 1 and 4.4 (SD = 4.8) on survey 2. Increased fatigue (odds ratio OR] = 1.14, p < 0.01), concerns for the future (OR = 1.13, p < 0.01), activity limitations (OR = 1.05, p < 0.01), and relapse history (OR = 2.18, p < 0.05) were associated with higher PTSS scores in the initial survey. Increased fatigue (OR = 1.16, p < 0.01), concerns for the future (OR = 1.14, p < 0.01), activity limitations (OR = 1.05, p < 0.05), and higher PTSS scores on the first survey (OR = 1.19, p < 0.01) were associated with higher PTSS scores in the subsequent survey. Longer time since diagnosis (OR = 0.85, p < 0.05; OR = 0.84, p < 0.05) was associated with lower PTSS scores on both surveys. Conclusions: Based on our findings, future research should examine the onset and trajectory of PTSS among HL survivors, focusing on early recognition and intervention to improve quality of life. © Copyright 2023, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2023.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HiTOP proposes that trauma-related distress is a facet of Internalizing psychopathology, but recent evidence with young people suggests that it may reflect a unique dimension of psychopathology. This study assessed the latent structure of child and adolescent psychopathology to determine whether there is evidence of a unique 'Traumatic Stress' dimension, and how dimensions of psychopathology are associated with specific types of childhood adversity and trauma, and suicidal ideation and self-injurious behavior. Participants were children and adolescents aged 1-17 years (N = 1,800) who were in contact with the Danish child protection system due to suspected child abuse. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to determine the optimal latent structure of psychopathology, and structural equation modelling was used to determine how the dimensions of psychopathology were associated with different forms of trauma and adversity and suicidality/self-harm. The best fitting model included three factors of Internalizing, Externalizing, and Traumatic Stress. The Traumatic Stress dimensions was associated with older age, living outside of the family home, parental mental illness, higher levels of parental conflict, and the presence of domestic violence in the child's home. The Traumatic Stress dimension was not associated with suicidality/self-harm. This study provides additional evidence of a distinct dimension of Traumatic Stress among young people. Further studies are needed to determine if these findings are replicable, particularly in older participants. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, as individuals can struggle with taking capsules, the objective of this double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial was to investigate the efficacy and safety of treating stress and well-being using an alternative delivery methodology: a powder that is absorbed via the oral mucosa. Seventy-two mild-severely stressed students, assessed using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), were randomized to placebo or micronutrients and took one powder pouch per day for 4 weeks. Seven (10%) dropped out with no group differences. Symptoms of stress, depression, anxiety, irritability, anger, sleep, diet, and side effects were measured with online questionnaires every 2 weeks. There were no group differences on the primary outcome measures of stress (DASS-21; d = 0.15, p = .525) and self-reported improvement (Modified Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale), with 17.1% of the micronutrient and 16.2% of the placebo group identifying themselves as ""much"" to ""very much"" improved.

No group differences were found on remaining measures, with both groups showing significant improvements. There were significantly more headaches and drowsiness reported in the micronutrient group. Belief in treatment assignment was significantly correlated to self-reported improvement (r = -0.247, p = .049).

Both delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are of potential therapeutic use. Evidence suggests that cannabis has a beneficial effect on neural circuitry involved in fear regulation. In the United States, cannabis is considered either medical or recreational and can contain pure THC or CBD or any combination thereof. The numerous cannabis compounds of various administration routes, with variable pharmacokinetics, further affect the cannabis conundrum. Despite being federally unregulated, medical cannabis has received increased attention socially, and at present, 37 states, four territories, and the District of Columbia have legalized medical cannabis for use in specific health conditions. Patients are increasingly inquiring about cannabis, and clinicians must educate themselves with reliable cannabinoid information for patient education. In adults with anxiety disorders and PTSD, evidence supports a relatively safe profile for medical cannabis; however, conclusive scientific evidential support of its therapeutic properties is limited, resulting in a lack of standardization and Food and Drug Administration approval.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparatively little is known concerning referral patterns to specialist veteran mental health services. Aims: To explore patterns of help-seeking over the decade to 2022 to a national specialist mental health service for UK military veterans. Methods: A dataset was created from electronic patient records for referrals between 2012 and 2022. Data included demographics, dates of referral, military service details including service length and operational deployments. Results: The mean time taken for veterans to seek help after leaving service appeared to modestly increase, when compared to previous studies. This is contrary to predictions from previous studies and potentially driven by a cohort effect of older veterans continuing to take longer to seek support than their younger peers. Further, early service leavers took longer to seek help. Over the course of the decade, the proportion of veterans with experience of operations in Iraq and/or Afghanistan increased; these individuals appeared to seek help more quickly than veterans who had served on previous deployments. The proportion of female veterans seeking referral increased over time. Conclusions: Although older veterans continue to present with mental health difficulties, those younger and with more recent deployment to Afghanistan are likely to represent the largest group seeking help in the coming years. These trends indicate that adequate specialist veteran mental health care provision is contingent on meeting the needs of veterans with a range of demographic and military profiles. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further, relationships among different types of IPV and perinatal PTSS remain understudied. Methods: Latent class and transition analyses were used to examine classes of PTSS in pregnancy and postpartum, the longitudinal patterns of transitions across these classes, and the role of IPV types, childhood adversity, and depressive symptoms in PTSS presentation. Participants (N = 238) were drawn from two longitudinal studies of high-risk perinatal women. Results: Four latent PTSS classes emerged: High, Avoidant, Hypervigilant, and Low. Childhood adversity (χ2(3) = 13.09, p = .004), prenatal depression (χ2(3) = 17.58, p = .001), and psychological IPV (χ2(3) = 10.51, p = .01) were associated with membership in High, Avoidant, and Hypervigilant classes. Women with low prenatal PTSS continued to have low levels at postpartum. Women in higher severity classes during pregnancy tended to transition into classes with adjacent, and often lower, levels of symptom severity postpartum. Women in the High PTSS class in pregnancy with elevated levels of depression were significantly more likely to remain in the High PTSS class or transition into the Avoidant class at postpartum, compared to the Low PTSS class, χ2(3) = 11.84, p = .008. Limitations: Relatively modest sample size precluded examination of a broader range of symptoms consistent with PTSD.

A number of articles have been published in the literature regarding delirium. However, it is unclear about article citations evolving in the field. This study proposed a temporal heatmap (THM) that can be applied to all bibliographical studies for a better understanding of cited articles worth reading. Methods: As of November 25, 2022, 11,668 abstracts published on delirium since 2013 were retrieved from the Web of Science core collection. Research achievements were measured using the CJAL score. Social network analysis was applied to examine clusters of keywords associated with core concepts of research. A THM was proposed to detect articles worth reading based on recent citations that are increasing. The 100 top-cited articles related to delirium were displayed on an impact beam plot (IBP). Results: The results indicate that the US (12474), Vanderbilt University (US) (634), Anesthesiology (2168), and Alessandro Morandi (Italy) (116) had the highest CJAL scores in countries, institutes, departments, and authors, respectively. Articles worthy of reading were highlighted on a THM and an IBP when an increasing trend of citations over the last 4 years was observed. Conclusion: The THM and IBP were proposed to highlight articles worth reading, and we recommend that more future bibliographical studies utilize the 2 visualizations and not restrict them solely to delirium-related articles in the future.

238,M6920,10.1016/j.jcomdis.2023.106313,A profile of prosodic speech differences in individuals with autism spectrum disorder and first-degree relatives,"Background: Impairments in prosody (e.g., intonation, stress) are among the most notable communication characteristics of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and can significantly impact communicative interactions. Evidence suggests that differences in prosody may be evident among first-degree relatives of autistic individuals, indicating that genetic liability to ASD is expressed through prosodic variation, along with subclinical traits referred to as the broad autism phenotype (BAP). This study aimed to further characterize prosodic profiles associated with ASD and the BAP to better understand the clinical and etiologic significance of prosodic differences. Method: Autistic individuals, their parents, and respective control groups completed the Profiling Elements of Prosody in Speech-Communication (PEPS-C), an assessment of receptive and expressive prosody. Responses to expressive subtests were further examined using acoustic analyses. Relationships between PEPS-C performance, acoustic measurements, and pragmatic language ability in conversation were assessed to understand how differences in prosody might contribute to broader ASD-related pragmatic profiles. Results: In ASD, receptive prosody deficits were observed in contrastive stress. With regard to expressive prosody, both the ASD and ASD Parent groups exhibited reduced accuracy in imitation, lexical stress, and contrastive stress expression compared to respective control groups, though no acoustic differences were noted. In ASD and Control groups, lower accuracy across several PEPS-C subtests and acoustic measurements related to increased pragmatic language violations. In parents, acoustic measurements were tied to broader pragmatic language and personality traits of the BAP. Conclusion: Overlapping areas of expressive prosody differences were identified in ASD and parents, providing evidence that prosody is an important language-related ability that may be impacted by genetic risk of ASD.

239,M8984,10.1016/j.chiabu.2023.106056,Predictors of symptom severity and change among youth in trauma-informed residential care,"Background: Trauma-informed residential care is an intensive intervention setting for youth, but research on its effectiveness is limited and yields mixed findings. Objectives: The study aims were to; 1) evaluate change over time of mental health (MH) symptoms over 21 months of trauma-informed residential care, and 2) examine the influence of demographic and risk factor variables (e.g. age, gender, trauma and placement history) on baseline symptoms and treatment response. Participants: A sample of 547 youth ages 12 to18 in trauma-informed residential care (Mage = 15.84 (SD = 1.56), 43.2 % male) were examined, with notable attrition over the study period. Method: Latent curve analysis (LCA) was used to estimate MH symptom severity at intake and change during 21 months (8 assessments total, intake and every 3 months) of care. Results: Trauma-informed residential care was associated with significant reductions in symptoms of PTSD (d = -0.76), depression (d = -0.59), dissociation (d = -0.60), psychological dysregulation (d = -0.94), and externalizing (d = -0.31), but not internalizing (d = 0.01) problems. Females had greater symptoms at intake across multiple indicators and showed equivalent or greater treatment response than males, although both groups improved. Neither cumulative trauma nor previous placement were associated with attenuated treatment response, but trauma history was positively associated with severity of multiple clinical measures at intake. Conclusions: Trauma-informed residential treatment can lead to reductions in clinical symptoms, even among multiply trauma-impacted youth. The extent of youth's trauma history did not negatively influence treatment response. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
240,M6921,10.4254/wjh.v15.i2.289,Racial and gender-based disparities and trends in common psychiatric conditions in liver cirrhosis hospitalizations: A ten-year United States study,"BACKGROUND Chronic liver disease is associated with various neuropsychiatric conditions. There are currently no large studies assessing and comparing the prevalence of psy-chiatric illnesses based on patient profiles and the etiology of cirrhosis. AIM To examine the trends of hospitalizations among psychiatric conditions in cirrhosis. METHODS We used the National Inpatient Sample database 2016-2019 for the primary diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. The outcomes included the prevalence, trends, and associations of psychiatric diagnoses in these hospitalizations. Chi-square for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank test for continuous variables were utilized. RESULTS The prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in liver cirrhosis hospitalizations increased from 0.17% in 2009 to 0.92% in 2019 (P < 0.001). The prevalence of depression increased from 7% in 2009 to 12% in 2019 (P < 0.001). Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) prevalence increased from 0.06% to 0.24%. The prevalence of schizophrenia increased from 0.59% to 0.87% (P < 0.001). Schizoaffective disorder prevalence increased from 0.10% to 0.35% (P < 0.001). Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prevalence displayed increasing trends from 0.36% in 2009 to 0.93% in 2019 (P < 0.001). The prevalence of suicidal ideation increased from 0.23% to 0.56% in 2019. Cirrhosis related to alcoholic liver disease adjusted odds ratios (aOR) 1.18, 95%CI 1.08-1.29, P < 0.001] and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (aOR 1.14, 95%CI 1.01-1.28, P = 0.025) was associated with depression more than other causes. Alcohol and NAFLD-associated cirrhosis had a stronger link to psychiatric disorders. Females had a higher association with GAD (aOR 2.56, 95%CI 2.14-3.06, P < 0.001), depression (aOR 1.78, 95%CI 1.71-1.84, P < 0.001), bipolar disorder (aOR 1.64, 95%CI 1.52-1.77, P < 0.001] and chronic fatigue (aOR 2.31, 95%CI 1.31-4.07, P < 0.001) when compared to males. Blacks, Hispanics, and Asian/Native Americans had a significantly lower association with GAD, depression, bipolar disorder, PTSD, and ADHD when compared to the white race. CONCLUSION The prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities in liver cirrhosis hospitalizations has increased over the last decade. Females had a higher association with psychiatric disorders compared to males. Blacks, Hispanics, and Asian/Native Americans had lower associations with psychiatric comorbidities compared to the white race. © The Author(s) 2023. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

241,M6030,10.1111/jnu.12906,"Stigma, social and structural vulnerability, and mental health among transgender women: A partial least square path modeling analysis","Introduction: Existing literature suggests that transgender women (TW) may be at high risk for adverse mental health due to stress attributed to combined experiences of stigma and complex social and structural vulnerabilities. Little research has examined how these co-occurring experiences relate to mental health. We aimed to test a theoretically driven conceptual model of relationships between stigma, social and structural vulnerabilities, and mental health to inform future intervention tailoring. Design/Methods: Partial least square path modeling followed by response-based unit segmentation was used to identify homogenous clusters in a diverse community sample of United States (US)-based TW (N = 1418; 46.2% White non-Hispanic). This approach examined associations between latent constructs of stigma (polyvictimization and discrimination), social and structural vulnerabilities (housing and food insecurity, unemployment, sex work, social support, and substance use), and mental health (post-traumatic stress and psychological distress). Results: The final conceptual model defined the structural relationship between the variables of interest within stigma, vulnerability, and mental health. Six clusters were identified within this structural framework which suggests that racism, ethnicism, and geography may be related to mental health inequities among TW. Conclusion: Our findings around the impact of racism, ethnicism, and geography reflect the existing literature, which unfortunately shows us that little change has occurred in the last decade for TW of color in the Southern US; however, the strength of our evidence (related to sampling structure and sample size) and type of analyses (accounting for co-occurring predictors of health, i.e., stigma and complex vulnerabilities, reflecting that of real-world patients) is a novel and necessary addition to the literature. Findings suggest that health interventions designed to offset the negative effects of stigma must include anti-racist approaches with components to reduce or eliminate barriers to resources that contribute to social and structural vulnerabilities among TW. Herein we provide detailed recommendations to guide primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention efforts. Clinical Relevance: This study demonstrated the importance of considering stigma and complex social and structural vulnerabilities during clinical care and design of mental health interventions for transgender women who are experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder and psychological distress. Specifically, interventions should take an anti-racist approach and would benefit from incorporating social support-building activities. © 2023 The Authors.

In the family-integrated care (FICare) model, parental involvement in neonatal care is emulated. Parental participation in medical rounds, or family-centred rounds (FCR), forms a key element. A paucity remains of randomised trials assessing the outcomes of FCR (embedded in FICare) in families and neonates, and outcomes on an organisational level are relatively unexplored. Likewise, biological mechanisms through which a potential effect may be exerted are lacking robust evidence. Ten level two Dutch neonatal wards are involved in this stepped-wedge cluster-randomised trial FCR (embedded in FICare) by one common implementation strategy. Parents of infants hospitalised for at least 7 days are eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome is parental stress (PSS:NICU) at discharge. Secondary outcomes include parental, neonatal, healthcare professional and organisational outcomes. Biomarkers of stress will be analysed in parent–infant dyads. With a practical approach and broad outcome set, this study aims to obtain evidence on the possible (mechanistic) effect of FCR (as part of FICare) on parents, infants, healthcare professionals and organisations. The practical approach provides (experiences of) FICare material adjusted to the Dutch setting, available for other hospitals after the study.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to identify profiles of COVID-19 stressors in refugees in a transit context (i.e., Indonesia) and examine the relationship between these profiles of stressors and mental health and well-being. Participants in this study included 913 refugees and asylum seekers living in Indonesia. The study was completed online in five languages (i.e., Arabic, Dari, Farsi, Somali, and English). A latent class analysis was implemented with 12 COVID-19 stressors representing indicator variables to identify profiles of COVID-19-related stressors experienced. Associations between COVID-19 classes and mental health (posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety) and well-being (physical and mental) outcomes were investigated. A five-class solution was identified as providing the best fit to the data as follows: (a) a high-COVID stressors class (18.1%), (b) a high access stressors class (13.2%), (c) an infection stressors class (22.7%), (d) a moderate access stressors class (23.1%), and (e) a low-COVID stressors class (22.8%). Membership of all classes reporting at least moderate levels of COVID-19 stressors was associated with greater mental health difficulties and lower physical and mental well-being than the low-COVID stressors class. Results indicated that the severity and type of stressors differed between groups suggesting heterogeneous experiences of the pandemic. Classes also differed according to contextual and social factors such as negative social support, language, and geographic area",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study is a longitudinal, nationally representative, online survey of UK adults. The current study analysed data from its first three waves of data collection: Wave 1 (March 2020, N = 2025), Wave 2 (April 2020, N = 1406) and Wave 3 (July 2020, N = 1166). Anxiety-depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (a composite measure of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7) and COVID-19-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the International Trauma Questionnaire. Changes in mental health outcomes were modelled across the three waves. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify subgroups of individuals with different trajectories of change in anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Latent class membership was regressed on baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of anxiety-depression remained stable, while COVID-19 PTSD reduced between Waves 2 and 3. Heterogeneity in mental health response was found, and hypothesised classes reflecting (i) stability, (ii) improvement and (iii) deterioration in mental health were identified. Psychological factors were most likely to differentiate the improving, deteriorating and high-stable classes from the low-stable mental health trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: A low-stable profile characterised by little-to-no psychological distress ('resilient' class) was the most common trajectory for both anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Monitoring these trajectories is necessary moving forward, in particular for the ~30% of individuals with increasing anxiety-depression levels.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
245,M6022,10.1017/S0033291721004025,Psychological responses to the COVID-19 pandemic are heterogeneous but have stabilised over time: 1 year longitudinal follow-up of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) study,"The current study extends the findings of Shevlin et al. by identifying trajectory patterns that were consistent with those initially reported from the analysis of the first three waves of C19PRC data. The current findings suggest that the vast majority of the sample experienced a homoeostatic mental health response over the course of the first year of the pandemic, with over two-thirds being characterised as 'Resilient', while about 15% were characterised as 'Moderate-Stable' and roughly 6% fell into the 'Chronic' category. Yet, for a minority of individuals (~12%), the months following the initial UK outbreak represented a period of rapid change in mental health, for better or worse. Notably, however, these trajectories plateaued from summer 2020 onwards, with only minor fluctuations in mental health scores during the period July 2020-March/April 2021. It may be that some individuals will experience a more delayed response to the pandemic, which has not fully manifested itself until much later after the traumatic event, as has been documented with the case of delayed-onset PTSD.

246,M8971,10.1111/sltb.12955,"Contribution of veterans' initial post-separation vocational, financial, and social experiences to their suicidal ideation trajectories following military service","BACKGROUND: Veterans' success with navigating the challenges of transition from military service may contribute to their risk for suicidal outcomes. The concept of well-being can help to conceptualize and assess successful navigation of reintegration challenges and may serve as an optimal target for public health-oriented suicide prevention. METHODS: The relationship between US veterans' psychosocial well-being and experiences of suicidal ideation (SI) during the first 3 years following military separation was evaluated using multinomial logistic regression predicting SI trajectories over time in a population-based, longitudinal, post-9/11 veteran cohort. At 3-months post-separation, veterans reported on their socio-material conditions, functioning, and satisfaction with respect to vocational, financial, and social domains. SI frequency was assessed at 3-, 9-, 15-, 21-, and 27-months post-separation using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. RESULTS: Veterans' vocational, financial, and social well-being were associated with their SI trajectories, even after accounting for mental health. Socio-material conditions, functioning, and satisfaction all emerged as important predictors of SI trajectories, although results varied across domains. Effects were largest for social well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Suicide prevention efforts may benefit from a holistic approach that considers veterans' needs for support across their vocational, financial, and social well-being, inclusive of their socio-material conditions, functioning, and satisfaction within each domain.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stepped care models (SCM) and culturally sensitive therapies offer promising treatment approaches to effectively provide necessary medical and psychological support. To our knowledge, we were the first to investigate whether a culturally sensitive SCM will reduce symptoms of depression and PTSD in ARAS more effectively and efficiently than treatment as usual (TAU). We conducted a multicentric, randomized, controlled and rater-blinded trial across Germany with ARAS between the ages of 14 to 21 years. Participants (N = 158) were stratified by their level of depressive symptom severity and then equally randomized to either SCM or TAU. Depending on their severity level, SCM participants were allocated to tailored interventions. Symptom changes were assessed for depression (PHQ) and PTSD (CATS) at four time points, with the primary end point at post-intervention after 12 weeks. Based on an intention-to-treat sample, we used a linear mixed model approach for the main statistical analyses. Further evaluations included cost-utility analyses, sensitivity analyses, follow-up-analyses, response and remission rates and subgroup analysis. We found a significant reduction of PHQ (d = 0.52) and CATS (d = 0.27) scores in both groups. However, there was no significant difference between SCM and TAU. Cost-utility analyses indicated that SCM generated greater cost-utility when measured as quality-adjusted life years compared to TAU. Subgroup analysis revealed different effects for the SCM interventions depending on the outcome measure. Although culturally sensitive, SCMs did not prove to be more effective in symptom change and represent a more cost-effective treatment alternative for mentally burdened ARAS. Our research contributes to the optimization of clinical productivity and the improvement of therapeutic care for ARAS. Disorder-specific interventions should be further investigated.

248,M4688,10.1017/S0033291723000636,Epigenetic aging and PTSD outcomes in the immediate aftermath of trauma,"BACKGROUND: Psychological trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been associated with advanced epigenetic age. However, whether epigenetic aging measured at the time of trauma predicts the subsequent development of PTSD outcomes is unknown. Moreover, the neural substrates underlying posttraumatic outcomes associated with epigenetic aging are unclear. METHODS: We examined a multi-ancestry cohort of women and men (n = 289) who presented to the emergency department (ED) after trauma. Blood DNA was collected at ED presentation, and EPIC DNA methylation arrays were used to assess four widely used metrics of epigenetic aging (HorvathAge, HannumAge, PhenoAge, and GrimAge). PTSD symptoms were evaluated longitudinally at the time of ED presentation and over the ensuing 6 months. Structural and functional neuroimaging was performed 2 weeks after trauma. RESULTS: After covariate adjustment and correction for multiple comparisons, advanced ED GrimAge predicted increased risk for 6-month probable PTSD diagnosis. Secondary analyses suggested that the prediction of PTSD by GrimAge was driven by worse trajectories for intrusive memories and nightmares. Advanced ED GrimAge was also associated with reduced volume of the whole amygdala and specific amygdala subregions, including the cortico-amygdaloid transition and the cortical and accessory basal nuclei. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed new light on the relation between biological aging and trauma-related phenotypes, suggesting that GrimAge measured at the time of trauma predicts PTSD trajectories and is associated with relevant brain alterations. Furthering these findings has the potential to enhance early prevention and treatment of posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify the differential impact of sexual trauma type(s) on psychosocial outcomes among veterans and non-veterans, we conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Comparative Health Assessment Interview Research Study, a large, national survey study sponsored by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Participants included veterans (n = 3588) and non-veterans (n = 935) who endorsed experiencing childhood sexual assault (CSA), adult sexual assault (ASA, outside of military service for veteran participants), and/or military sexual assault (MSA). Eight measures were used to assess psychosocial outcomes: Well-Being Inventory (WBI) health satisfaction and physical health functioning items, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist, Patient Health Questionnaire (depression symptoms), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire, WBI social satisfaction items, WBI social functioning items, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (social). A profile analysis was used to determine how sexual trauma type(s) influenced the pattern of responding to the eight psychosocial outcome measures. Veteran sexual assault survivors reported poorer psychological outcomes compared to non-veteran sexual assault survivors. Non-veteran sexual assault survivors reported poorer outcomes on the majority of social variables compared to veteran sexual assault survivors. Survivors of MSA-only reported poorer psychosocial outcomes compared to veteran and non-veteran survivors of CSA-only and ASA-only on most of the variables assessed. Survivors of ASA-only reported similar or modestly worse psychosocial outcomes when compared to survivors of CSA-only on the majority of variables assessed.

However, research examining how such factors coalesce to impact risk for suicide remains limited. Methods: We conducted a latent class analysis of 180,454 Veterans accessing Veterans Health Administration (VHA) justice-related services from 2005 to 2018. Results: A four-model class membership solution was identified. Among these classes, risk for suicide was highest among Veterans with greater psychiatric burden, with risk most notable among those with high VA service use. Veterans seeking healthcare primarily focused on substance use disorders or with low psychiatric burden and service use had a lower risk for suicide. Conclusions: Psychiatric multimorbidity is salient as it relates to suicide among Veterans accessing VHA justice-related services. Further evaluation of existing VHA services for this population and methods of augmenting and enhancing care for justice-involved Veterans with histories of co-occurring psychiatric conditions may be beneficial in facilitating suicide prevention efforts.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
252,M6932,10.1037/trm0000444,Trauma resilience on campus: The moderating effect of developmental assets in the link between trauma exposure and posttraumatic symptomatology in college emerging adults,"Background: Existing literature establishes several patterns regarding exposure to severe stressors-most people experience one or more traumatic events, most people are resilient following such events, and people are more likely to develop posttraumatic symptomatology if experiencing repeated traumas. However, questions about protective factors remain as researchers work to clarify the mechanisms of resilience. Here, we argue the developmental assets framework is an apt model for conceptualizing resilience in emerging adults in college/university settings, a high-risk population for both trauma exposure and subsequent distress. We hypothesized that asset-richness (i.e., total scores on the developmental assets inventory) would moderate the link between trauma exposure frequency and severity of posttrauma symptomatology. Method: We surveyed a convenience sample of emerging adults at a private religiously affiliated university in the Midwestern United States (n = 526) regarding trauma exposure (THQ), perceived developmental assets (CAMPUS), and experience of posttrauma symptoms (PCL-S). We ran correlations, linear regression, and moderator analysis using the PROCESS ""Model 1"" macro and the CAHOST Johnson-Neyman region visualizer. Results: We found that posttraumatic symptom severity was positively correlated with the frequency of trauma exposure (r = .30, p < .001) and negatively correlated with asset-richess (r = -.26, p < .001), and that asset-richness statistically significantly moderated the link between trauma exposure and posttrauma symptoms, F(3, 522) = 31.87, p < .001, R2 = .16. Discussion: The developmental assets framework appears to be an effective model of resilience for many emerging adults in college/university settings, and we encourage future research to further clarify these connections.

Using all available data collected from 4119 Military service members before and after their deployment to Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom, we tested whether predeployment characteristics clustered together to predict postdeployment suicidal risk. Latent class analysis showed that three classes best characterized the sample at predeployment. Class 1 had significantly higher scores on PTSD severity pre- and postdeployment than Classes 2 and 3 (Ps < .001). At postdeployment, Class 1 also had a greater proportion of endorsement of lifetime and past year suicidal ideation than Classes 2 and 3 (Ps < .05) and a greater proportion of lifetime suicide attempts than Class 3 (P < .001).

Among 212 IPV survivors, this study examined these and the differential associations by PTSD symptom cluster and types of DE. In the current sample, 67.9% met criteria for probable PTSD, 20.3% met criteria for a probable eating disorder, and 18.4% had probable comorbid diagnoses. Consistent with escape theory, there was an indirect effect of IPV on DE through PTSD symptoms. Additionally, there was an indirect effect of IPV on weight/shape concerns and binge symptoms through PTSD symptoms. Although there was a significant total effect of IPV on compensatory behaviors, there was no indirect effect through PTSD symptoms. When PTSD symptom clusters were examined concurrently, the only indirect effect of IPV on weight/shape concerns was via the PTSD symptom cluster of negative alterations in cognition and mood. Although there was an indirect effect of IPV on binge symptoms via PTSD symptoms overall, no specific PTSD symptom cluster drove this association. Implications highlight the need for attention to DE within this population. Consistent with escape theory, survivors' DE might serve to distract from psychological distress.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

256,M8949,10.1016/bs.irn.2022.11.002,Metabotropic glutamate receptor function and regulation of sleep-wake cycles,"Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors are the most abundant family of G-protein coupled receptors and are widely expressed throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Alterations in glutamate homeostasis, including dysregulations in mGlu receptor function, have been indicated as key contributors to multiple CNS disorders. Fluctuations in mGlu receptor expression and function also occur across diurnal sleep-wake cycles. Sleep disturbances including insomnia are frequently comorbid with neuropsychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative conditions. These often precede behavioral symptoms and/or correlate with symptom severity and relapse. Chronic sleep disturbances may also be a consequence of primary symptom progression and can exacerbate neurodegeneration in disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, there is a bidirectional relationship between sleep disturbances and CNS disorders; disrupted sleep may serve as both a cause and a consequence of the disorder. Importantly, comorbid sleep disturbances are rarely a direct target of primary pharmacological treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders even though improving sleep can positively impact other symptom clusters. This chapter details known roles of mGlu receptor subtypes in both sleep-wake regulation and CNS disorders focusing on schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, AD, and substance use disorder (cocaine and opioid). In this chapter, preclinical electrophysiological, genetic, and pharmacological studies are described, and, when possible, human genetic, imaging, and post-mortem studies are also discussed. In addition to reviewing the important relationships between sleep, mGlu receptors, and CNS disorders, this chapter highlights the development of selective mGlu receptor ligands that hold promise for improving both primary symptoms and sleep disturbances. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a retrospective medical record review of adult (≥ 18 years) resettled refugees between May 2001 and December 2012 at a community health center in Northeast Massachusetts. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics pertaining to neuropsychiatric health were collected from medical records using a standardized data extraction tool. Group comparisons between those with and without neurological illness and associated sociodemographic and psychiatric characteristics were evaluated using χ2 and independent samples two-tailed t-tests. In our sample (n = 779), 53.3% (n = 415) were male and 48.8% (n = 380) were from the African continent. The mean age was 33.2 ± 12.4 years (range 18-85). 36.8% were diagnosed with at least one neurological disorder and 18.1% with more than one neurological illness. The most common diagnoses were headaches (28.3%), sleep disorders (11.2%), cognitive impairment/ dementia (5.5%), and head trauma (5.5%). Exploratory analyses revealed that participants with neurological illness were more likely to be older (p < .001), female (p = .002), and diagnosed with co-morbid psychiatric diagnoses (p < .001) than those without neurological illness. Neurological disorders frequently co-occur with psychiatric comorbidities among U.S. resettled adult refugees. Standard refugee health assessments should incorporate screening and treatment for neurological illnesses.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because families' levels of functioning and well-being vary widely within low-income samples, we used a person-centered approach to understand how variations among families are linked with children's social-emotional skills. Our latent profile analysis of a sample of 246 families identified three profiles of family functioning and well-being: low stress, high family functioning (63%); moderate family stress, low family functioning (25%); and high psychological distress and parenting stress (12%). Children's social-emotional functioning, both social competence and problem behavior, related to profile membership. Children in the low stress, high family functioning profile displayed the most optimal social-emotional skills. These results highlight the importance of supporting family functioning and decreasing family stress to influence young children's positive behaviors.

Using latent profile analysis, four distinctive latent profiles emerged: Marginalized, Ambivalent, Disengaged, and Embedded. Beta regression analyses suggested that identity centrality played a pivotal role in a participants' membership to a given profile. Additionally, plurisexual and gender diverse identities may be associated with less likelihood of membership in profiles that were high in LGBTQ+ community resilience resources. Profile membership was also associated with mental health, internalized minority stress, and LGBTQ+ identity affirmation. The present study assists in expanding the understanding of co-occurring processes (i.e., community resilience resources and inequity within the LGBTQ+ community) and how they link to mental health, internalized minority stress, and positive LGBTQ+ identity outcomes for sexual and gender diverse people. We discuss implications for practice, education, training, and research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
260,M4685,10.1037/adb0000788,Coping-motivated escalations in adolescent alcohol problems following early adversity,"Objective: The present study examined whether early stressful events precipitate drinking risks across adolescence and whether coping-motivated drinking mediates such relations. Method: Families comprised 387 adolescents (55% female, 83% White) recruited for a longitudinal study. Caregivers reported on adolescents' experience of potentially stressful events, including conflict (i.e., disruption of harmonious family relations) and separation (i.e., decreased contact with important persons) events, over the past year when adolescents were approximately 14 years of age. Adolescents reported on their drinking motives, alcohol use, and alcohol problems annually from 18 to 20 years of age. Growth curve models tested associations of stressful events with latent coping and enhancement/social drinking motives growth factors and subsequent alcohol outcomes. Results: Most adolescents experienced at least one potentially stressful event. Growth modeling suggested no change in coping motives, but increases in enhancement/social motives over time. Greater conflict events predicted higher frequency of drinking for coping reasons (i.e., coping intercept), which in turn predicted increases in alcohol problems as adolescents began transitioning into young adulthood. Conflict, separation, or total stressful events were not significantly associated with initial level or change in enhancement/social motives, suggesting specificity of mediation by coping-motivated drinking. Conclusions: Findings support enduring elevations in drinking risk over 6 years following disruptive family relations in early adolescence. Such risks appear to be driven by negative affect regulation mechanisms through coping-motivated drinking. Future work should assess generalizability of these findings across diverse samples and could test similar negative reinforcement mechanisms of drinking following exposure to clinically impairing traumatic experiences. Public Health Significance Statement: This study demonstrated that disruptive family relations in early adolescence are linked to greater motivation to drink to cope with negative affect up to 6 years later. Greater coping motives, in turn, were related to increases in alcohol problems over time, even when controlling for alcohol consumption.

Canada’s first student recovery program launched in 2019, with six additional launching shortly thereafter. The current study offers a first look at the student experience in recovery programs at the first Canadian institutions to offer recovery support on campus. We used qualitative methods to examine individual recovery trajectories, program participation, stigma, barriers to recovery on campus, and the impact of a campus-based recovery program on various areas of their lives. Our findings highlight three main themes: (i) inclusivity and diversity of the programs, (ii) increasing recovery capital and dimensions of well-being, and (iii) reducing barriers to recovery on campus. The results inform how Canadian student recovery programs meet the needs of their students and identify areas for improvement using a recovery-informed lens to center the lived experiences of students in recovery. Findings from this initial study may drive the development of future student recovery programs at Canadian institutions and inform new initiatives by existing programs outside of Canada.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
262,M8915,10.1016/j.ssmmh.2023.100258,How is trauma-related distress experienced and expressed in populations from the Greater Middle East and North Africa? A systematic review of qualitative literature,"The Greater MENA region has high rates of political, social, and structural violence exposure, however there is a discrepancy in reported rates of PTSD in comparison with other areas of the world. This may be due to cultural variations in the conceptualization and expression of traumatic stress. More generally, there has been ongoing tension between theories of universality versus cultural variance in mental health. Quantitative evidence shows that similar symptoms emerge in the aftermath of trauma across cultures. At the same time, a growing body of evidence indicates the integral role of culture in shaping the etiology and phenomenology of mental disorders. Research exploring local narratives of individuals exposed to violence within the Greater MENA region is increasing, but no review has summarized findings of this body of research yet. This systematic review aimed to critically examine qualitative literature investigating how PTSD, CPTSD, any other forms of culturally-acknowledged trauma-related distress are experienced and expressed among people living in the Greater MENA region. Results covered CCD, culturally normalized symptoms of distress, PTSD, and CPTSD symptoms. Main symptom clusters of PTSD and CPTSD were endorsed with variations on particular symptom expressions. Studies provided sociocultural norms guiding such symptom expressions and highlighted the importance of structural factors in maintaining and perpetuating traumatic distress. The discussion section situates these findings within broader literature to deepen our understanding, and thus provide practical and research recommendations for more comprehensive and culturally-relevant understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of traumatic stress with the Greater MENA region. © 2023 The Authors",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pragmatic and implementation studies have natural areas of overlap, particularly relating to the goal of using clinical trial data to leverage health care system policy changes. Few investigations have addressed pragmatic and implementation science randomized trial methods development while also considering policy impact. Methods: The investigation used the PRagmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary-2 (PRECIS-2) and PRECIS-2-Provider Strategies (PRECIS-2-PS) tools to evaluate the design of two multisite randomized clinical trials that targeted patient-level effectiveness outcomes, provider-level practice changes and health care system policy. Seven raters received PRECIS-2 training and applied the tools in the coding of the two trials. Descriptive statistics were produced for both trials, and PRECIS-2 wheel diagrams were constructed. Interrater agreement was assessed with the Intraclass Correlation (ICC) and Kappa statistics. The Rapid Assessment Procedure Informed Clinical Ethnography (RAPICE) qualitative approach was applied to understanding integrative themes derived from the PRECIS-2 ratings and an end-of-study policy summit. Results: The ICCs for the composite ratings across the patient and provider-focused PRECIS-2 domains ranged from 0.77 to 0.87, and the Kappa values ranged from 0.25 to 0.37, reflecting overall fair-to-good interrater agreement for both trials. All four PRECIS-2 wheels were rated more pragmatic than explanatory, with composite mean and median scores ≥ 4. Across trials, the primary intent-to-treat analysis domain was consistently rated most pragmatic (mean = 5.0, SD = 0), while the follow-up/data collection domain was rated most explanatory (mean range = 3.14–3.43, SD range = 0.49–0.69). RAPICE field notes identified themes related to potential PRECIS-2 training improvements, as well as policy themes related to using trial data to inform US trauma care system practice change; the policy themes were not captured by the PRECIS-2 ratings. Conclusions: The investigation documents that the PRECIS-2 and PRECIS-2-PS can be simultaneously used to feasibly and reliably characterize clinical trials with patient and provider-level targets. The integration of pragmatic and implementation science clinical trial research methods can be furthered by using common metrics such as the PRECIS-2 and PRECIS-2-PS.

264,M6906,10.1037/tra0001417,"Perceived meaning, pandemic self-efficacy, social support, and discrimination predict trajectories of peri-pandemic growth and distress for international students","Objective: International students face unique COVID-19-related stressors, such as financial aid loss, limited social support, and discrimination (e.g., verbal harassment, physical assault). Additionally, pandemic and chronic stress research is largely cross-sectional, and trajectories over time remain unclear for psychological and environmental factors predicting distress and peri-pandemic growth. Accordingly, the current study examined trajectories of psychological distress and growth, as well as weekly psychological and environmental predictors of psychological distress and growth, in international students during the early stages of the pandemic. Method: International students (N = 42) at a U.S. university were surveyed weekly for 14 weeks. Results: Latent growth mixture modeling resulted in three trajectories over time of distress (Minimal Impact, Emergent Resilience, and Increasing Distress) and peri-pandemic growth (Limited PrTG, Decreasing PrTG, and Increasing PrTG). For multilevel models, within-person increases in meaning and self-efficacy as well as between-person changes in discrimination and emotional social support predicted distress. Within-person changes in meaning and self-efficacy and between-person changes in self-efficacy and discrimination predicted peri-pandemic growth. Conclusions: Despite the stressors they face, many international students demonstrated a trajectory of resilience. Positive coping factors and environmental factors predicted distress or peri-pandemic growth, which can inform interventions and studies examining trajectories of distress during prolonged adversity. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement The current study found that international students were resilient during the early stages of the pandemic, despite experiencing additive stressors. Additionally, the current study identified coping factors (i.e., meaning in life, self-efficacy) and environmental factors (e.g., discrimination, social support) that were related to distress and posttraumatic growth. These findings provide insight into trajectories of distress during stressful events and identify factors that predict changes in distress, which has the potential to inform interventions and policy changes for international students.

265,M9008,10.1017/S0033291723001642,Associations of alcohol and cannabis use with change in posttraumatic stress disorder and depression symptoms over time in recently trauma-exposed individuals,"BACKGROUND: Several hypotheses may explain the association between substance use, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression. However, few studies have utilized a large multisite dataset to understand this complex relationship. Our study assessed the relationship between alcohol and cannabis use trajectories and PTSD and depression symptoms across 3 months in recently trauma-exposed civilians. METHODS: In total, 1618 (1037 female) participants provided self-report data on past 30-day alcohol and cannabis use and PTSD and depression symptoms during their emergency department (baseline) visit. We reassessed participant's substance use and clinical symptoms 2, 8, and 12 weeks posttrauma. Latent class mixture modeling determined alcohol and cannabis use trajectories in the sample. Changes in PTSD and depression symptoms were assessed across alcohol and cannabis use trajectories via a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Three trajectory classes (low, high, increasing use) provided the best model fit for alcohol and cannabis use. The low alcohol use class exhibited lower PTSD symptoms at baseline than the high use class; the low cannabis use class exhibited lower PTSD and depression symptoms at baseline than the high and increasing use classes; these symptoms greatly increased at week 8 and declined at week 12. Participants who already use alcohol and cannabis exhibited greater PTSD and depression symptoms at baseline that increased at week 8 with a decrease in symptoms at week 12. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that alcohol and cannabis use trajectories are associated with the intensity of posttrauma psychopathology. These findings could potentially inform the timing of therapeutic strategies.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
266,M6036,10.1016/j.eclinm.2023.102063,Psychiatric disorders and subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease: a longitudinal matched cohort study across three countries,"BACKGROUND: Several psychiatric disorders have been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), however, the role of familial factors and the main disease trajectories remain unknown. METHODS: In this longitudinal cohort study, we identified a cohort of 900,240 patients newly diagnosed with psychiatric disorders during January 1, 1987 and December 31, 2016, their 1,002,888 unaffected full siblings, and 1:10 age- and sex-matched reference population from nationwide medical records in Sweden, who had no prior diagnosis of CVD at enrolment. We used flexible parametric models to determine the time-varying association between first-onset psychiatric disorders and incident CVD and CVD death, comparing rates of CVD among patients with psychiatric disorders to the rates of unaffected siblings and matched reference population. We also used disease trajectory analysis to identify main disease trajectories linking psychiatric disorders to CVD. Identified associations and disease trajectories of the Swedish cohort were validated in a similar cohort from nationwide medical records in Denmark (N = 875,634 patients, same criteria during January 1, 1969 and December 31, 2016) and in Estonian cohorts from the Estonian Biobank (N = 30,656 patients, same criteria during January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2020), respectively. FINDINGS: During up to 30 years of follow-up of the Swedish cohort, the crude incidence rate of CVD was 9.7, 7.4 and 7.0 per 1000 person-years among patients with psychiatric disorders, their unaffected siblings, and the matched reference population. Compared with their siblings, patients with psychiatric disorders experienced higher rates of CVD during the first year after diagnosis (hazard ratio HR], 1.88; 95% confidence interval CI], 1.79-1.98) and thereafter (1.37; 95% CI, 1.34-1.39). Similar rate increases were noted when comparing with the matched reference population. These results were replicated in the Danish cohort. We identified several disease trajectories linking psychiatric disorders to CVD in the Swedish cohort, with or without mediating medical conditions, including a direct link between psychiatric disorders and hypertensive disorder, ischemic heart disease, venous thromboembolism, angina pectoris, and stroke. These trajectories were validated in the Estonian Biobank cohort. INTERPRETATION: Independent of familial factors, patients with psychiatric disorders are at an elevated risk of subsequent CVD, particularly during first year after diagnosis. Increased surveillance and treatment of CVDs and CVD risk factors should be considered as an integral part of clinical management, in order to reduce risk of CVD among patients with psychiatric disorders.

267,M6038,10.1038/s41380-022-01913-z,A paradigm shift in translational psychiatry through rodent neuroethology,"Mental disorders are a significant cause of disability worldwide. They profoundly affect individuals’ well-being and impose a substantial financial burden on societies and governments. However, despite decades of extensive research, the effectiveness of current therapeutics for mental disorders is often not satisfactory or well tolerated by the patient. Moreover, most novel therapeutic candidates fail in clinical testing during the most expensive phases (II and III), which results in the withdrawal of pharma companies from investing in the field. It also brings into question the effectiveness of using animal models in preclinical studies to discover new therapeutic agents and predict their potential for treating mental illnesses in humans. Here, we focus on rodents as animal models and propose that they are essential for preclinical investigations of candidate therapeutic agents’ mechanisms of action and for testing their safety and efficiency. Nevertheless, we argue that there is a need for a paradigm shift in the methodologies used to measure animal behavior in laboratory settings. Specifically, behavioral readouts obtained from short, highly controlled tests in impoverished environments and social contexts as proxies for complex human behavioral disorders might be of limited face validity. Conversely, animal models that are monitored in more naturalistic environments over long periods display complex and ethologically relevant behaviors that reflect evolutionarily conserved endophenotypes of translational value. We present how semi-natural setups in which groups of mice are individually tagged, and video recorded continuously can be attainable and affordable. Moreover, novel open-source machine-learning techniques for pose estimation enable continuous and automatic tracking of individual body parts in groups of rodents over long periods. The trajectories of each individual animal can further be subjected to supervised machine learning algorithms for automatic detection of specific behaviors (e.g., chasing, biting, or fleeing) or unsupervised automatic detection of behavioral motifs (e.g., stereotypical movements that might be harder to name or label manually). Compared to studies of animals in the wild, semi-natural environments are more compatible with neural and genetic manipulation techniques. As such, they can be used to study the neurobiological mechanisms underlying naturalistic behavior. Hence, we suggest that such a paradigm possesses the best out of classical ethology and the reductive behaviorist approach and may provide a breakthrough in discovering new efficient therapies for mental illnesses.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intolerance of uncertainty (IU), or a fear of the unknown, has been consistently linked with PTSS. However, no research has examined IU and PTSS across different trauma types. The current study examined whether differences exist in the relationship between IU and PTSS across sexual (n = 79) and non-sexual violence (n = 168) trauma subsamples. Baseline data from a diverse sample of participants enrolled in a randomized control treatment trial was used and participants were grouped according to trauma type. Results indicated that rates of IU did not differ across trauma types subsamples (p =.84), whereas PTSS levels did (p <.02). Within non-sexual violence trauma survivors, IU was significantly associated with PTSD arousal symptoms. Within the sexual violence sample, all symptom clusters, except re-experiencing symptoms, were significantly associated with IU.

METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of cross-sectional program evaluation data among 95 young people (aged 11-19) at therapy initiation in a southeastern state in the U.S. We used descriptive statistics and multivariable linear regression to test study objectives. RESULTS: Eighty-one respondents (90.0%) experienced a potentially traumatic event in ≥ 2 trauma categories, in addition to experiencing CSE/T. Approximately two-thirds of respondents experienced clinically significant PTSD symptoms for each symptom cluster. Of the 31 young people who met full criteria for PTSD, 9 met criteria for the standard PTSD diagnosis, while 22 met criteria for the dissociative subtype of PTSD. On average, experiencing additional trauma categories was associated with substantively higher PTSD symptom cluster scores for each cluster. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the need for a comprehensive assessment of trauma symptoms that includes cluster-specific PTSD symptoms. They also underscore the need to assess the full breadth and chronicity of trauma experiences to guide treatment planning and delivery, targeting specific domains of trauma impact. These findings can also inform the tailoring and adaptation of evidence-based interventions and strategies to better meet the needs of young people who have experienced CSE/T.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Purposes were to evaluate for differences in global, cancer-specific, and cumulative life stress, as well as resilience and the use of coping strategies among three subgroups of patients with distinct sleep disturbance profiles (i.e., Low, High, Very High). Oncology outpatients (n = 1331) completed measures of global (Perceived Stress Scale), cancer-specific (Impact of Event Scale-Revised), and cumulative life (Life Stressor Checklist-Revised) stress, resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale) and coping (Brief Cope) prior to their second or third cycle of chemotherapy. Sleep disturbance was assessed six times over two chemotherapy cycles. Differences were evaluated using parametric and non-parametric tests. All stress measures showed a dose response effect (i.e., as the sleep disturbance profile worsened, levels of all types of stress increased). Compared to Low class, the other two classes reported higher levels of global perceived stress and higher occurrence rates and effect from previous stressful life events. Impact of Event Scale-Revised scores for the Very High class indicated post-traumatic symptomatology. Patients in High and Very High classes had resilience scores below the normative score for the United States population and used a higher number of disengagement coping strategies. Our findings suggest that very high levels of sleep disturbance are associated with higher levels of various types of stress, lower levels of resilience, and higher use of disengagement coping strategies. Clinicians need to perform routine assessments and implement symptom management interventions to reduce stress and encourage the use of engagement coping strategies.

273,M4700,,Understanding anger and psychosocial functioning in a sample of post-9/11 veterans using ecological momentary assessment,"Anger is an important aspect of the negative emotion associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and difficulties with anger regulation are implicated in more severe PTSD trajectories as well as associated problems such as aggression perpetration. Anger is also known to erode social relationships and is implicated in poorer psychosocial functioning and having fewer close relationships. From a diagnostic conceptualization, anger is included in both the hyperarousal symptom cluster (e.g. irritability and angry reactions) and the negative alterations in cognitions and mood symptom cluster (e.g. negative emotions like anger, fear, shame, etc). Although anger is included in the diagnostic symptoms of PTSD, it is not often a specific focus of research and there are few investigations of anger on a granular level. This study assessed anger and psychosocial functioning in a sample of post-9/11 veterans with PTSD (N = 70; 87.1% cisgender men; 60.0% white, 32.9% African American/Black; Mage = 37.6 years SD = 7.8]) using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to capture daily reports of anger frequency and intensity. Hierarchical and simple linear regressions were used to investigate between-subjects relations among PTSD symptoms, anger reported via EMA, and indices of psychosocial functioning. Primary results from this study demonstrated that anger reported via EMA significantly predicted greater impairment in some domains of psychosocial functioning, after controlling for PTSD symptom severity. Findings from this study suggest that the frequency and intensity of experiences of anger in veteran's day-to-day lives may contribute to psychosocial functioning impairment beyond the expected deleterious impact of PTSD. A nuanced measurement of anger may have clinical utility in predicting psychosocial functioning among veterans with PTSD.

Latent class analysis (LCA) is a person-centered statistical approach that finds subtypes of related cases based on item-responses. There has been a growing interest in conducting LCA on PGD, but no research synthesis exists to date. Aim of this systematic review was to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of research on LCAs on PGD and other indicators of mental health in bereaved adults and to rate the quality of these LCA studies. Method: A systematic literature search was conducted in PsycInfo, Psyndex, Web of Science and PubMed in September 2022. Inclusion criteria required that a LCA was conducted including PGD and additional mental health indicators in bereaved adults. Quality of LCAs was rated using Guidelines for Reporting on Latent Class Analyses (GRoLCA). Results: Twenty-one studies published between 2014 and 2022 with a median of 308 participants were reviewed. Studies comprised samples from six continents confronted with violent (k = 9), natural losses (k = 8) or both (k = 4). In addition to PGD symptoms as principal latent class indicators, studies included PTSD (k = 5), depression (k = 3), or both (k = 10). The majority of studies identified three (k = 16, 76%) or four latent classes (k = 4, 19%). Most studies found a resilient (k = 19, 91%) and a high symptom (k = 20, 95.2%) class. Fourteen studies (66.7%) found classes predominantly marked by PGD symptoms. Discussion: Despite the diversity of included samples and LCA indicators of mental health, several types of latent classes were similar across studies. Caution, however, is warranted when comparing results across studies, since inconsistencies about interpreting and reporting LCA models limited the comparability of studies.

Using a longitudinal sample of 3,085 parents from across the United States who had a child or children age 0 to 5, in the present study, we identified parental mental-health trajectories from April to November 2020 predicted by pre-COVID-19 cumulative risk and COVID-19-specific risk factors. Both growth-mixture modeling and latent-growth-curve modeling were used to test the relationship between risk factors and parent mental health. Pre-COVID-19 cumulative risk and COVID-19-specific risks of financial strain, decreased employment, and increased family conflict were salient risk factors predicting poor mental-health trajectories across both modeling approaches. These finding have public-health implications because prolonged exposure to mental-health symptoms in parents constitutes a risk factor for child development.

We examined two heart rate variability metrics: deceleration capacity (DC) and logarithmic low frequency (log-LF) power from beat-to-beat intervals extracted from ambulatory electrocardiograms. We assessed longitudinal PTSD status with a structured clinical interview and the severity with the PTSD Symptoms Scale. We used linear mixed-effects models to examine twin dyads and account for cardiovascular and behavioral risk factors. We examined 238 male Veteran twins (age 68 +/- 3 years old, 4% black). PTSD status and acute PTSD symptom severity were not associated with DC or log-LF measured during the neutral session, but were significantly associated with lower DC and log-LF during the traumatic script listening session. Long-standing PTSD was associated with a 0.38 (95% confidence interval, -0.83,-0.08) and 0.79 (-1.30,-0.29) standardized unit lower DC and log-LF, respectively, compared to no history of PTSD. Traumatic reminders in patients with PTSD lead to real-time autonomic dysregulation and suggest a potential causal mechanism for increased CVD risk, based on the well-known relationships between autonomic dysfunction and CVD mortality.

277,M9076,10.1037/tra0001257,More is not always better: 2 weeks of intensive cognitive processing therapy-based treatment are noninferior to 3 weeks,"Objective: Although there is mounting evidence that massed treatment for PTSD is both feasible and effective, many questions remain about the optimal length of intensive treatment programs (ITPs), as well as the role of adjunctive services, such as psychoeducation, mindfulness, and yoga. Our setting recently transitioned from a three-week ITP to a two-week program. Adjunctive services were reduced, but the amount of individual CPT between programs remained similar. The present study examined the effectiveness of a two-week ITP based on twice daily individual CPT sessions and evaluated the program's noninferiority to an established three-week ITP using a Bayesian analytical approach. Method: Bayesian linear mixed regression models were used to explore PTSD and depression changes over time, as well as predictors of change. Noninferiority of the two-week ITP to a three-week ITP was also established using a Bayes factor approach. Results: Results indicate that program participants change meaningfully in both PTSD and depression severity over the course of treatment, and that changes in posttraumatic cognitions predict subsequent changes in these outcomes. Further, the two-week ITP can be considered noninferior to the three-week ITP in both clinical outcomes and overall satisfaction. Conclusions: In the context of intensive PTSD treatment, the content of the ITP appears to matter more than its overall length. Shorter programs have the potential to increase access and treatment capacity. Our findings demonstrate the importance of continuous and rigorous program evaluation. Limitations as well as future directions for research, such as identifying the most effective treatment components, are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement The present study compared 2 intensive treatment programs for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The 2- and 3-week-long programs were based on daily Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) as well as adjunctive services. The two-week program had fewer overall service hours but offered a comparable amount of CPT. Both programs produced large and equivalent PTSD and depression severity reductions. The findings suggest that the more/longer treatment is not necessarily better and that content of the intensive PTSD treatment programs appears to matter more than its overall length. Shorter PTSD treatment programs have the potential to increase access and capacity. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although changes in negative posttrauma cognitions (NPCs) are considered a likely PTSD treatment mechanism, less is known about how NPCs change among individuals who continue to be symptomatic following treatment (non-optimal responders). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine NPC change trajectories among individuals who were determined to be non-optimally responsive to intensive PTSD treatment. METHOD: Using a 3-week Cognitive Processing Therapy-based intensive PTSD treatment sample (ITP; N = 243), the present study examined the number of distinct NPC change trajectories among non-optimal responders via Group Based Trajectory Modeling and assessed predictors of non-optimal responders' NPC change trajectory membership. Analyses were replicated in a separate 2-week ITP sample (N = 215). RESULTS: In both non-optimal responder samples, two trajectories emerged; a no NPC change group which represented those with an overall lack of NPC change throughout treatment and an NPC change group which represented those with an overall reduction of NPCs occurring primarily later in treatment. Changes in PTSD symptom severity during treatment was the only consistent predictor of NPC change trajectory group membership among treatment non-optimal responders across ITPs. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest NPC change among non-optimal responders is nuanced and may inform subsequent intervention selection, resulting in testable hypotheses for future research.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the frequency of female sexual dysfunctions (FSD) as defined by DSM-5 among women with PTSD due to CSA. Furthermore, factors related to FSD in this patient population are understudied. To assess prevalence rates and clinical correlates of FSD according to DSM-5 criteria in women with PTSD after CSA, a structured clinical interview for sexual dysfunctions according to DSM-5 criteria was administered in a sample of 137 women with PTSD after CSA. Participants also completed measures for PTSD, depression symptoms, and borderline personality disorder symptoms. The association between FSD, severity of abuse, PTSD-, depression-, borderline symptom severity, and age was examined. In a second step, the association between FSD and PTSD-clusters was assessed. Diagnostic criteria of female sexual interest/arousal disorder (FSIAD) were met by 2.6% of women in our sample. 5.2% met criteria of female orgasmic disorder (FOD), and 11.8% those of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder (GPPPD). PTSD symptom severity predicted number of fulfilled criteria of FSIAD and FOD, the cluster ""negative alterations in cognition and mood,"" was associated with more fulfilled criteria in FSIAD and FOD. The majority of women reported sexual problems, but diagnostic criteria of FSD were met by only a small number of participants. PTSD symptoms, especially the cluster ""negative alterations in cognition and mood,"" seem to be related to female sexual functioning after CSA.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand whether these problems might be exacerbated during times of elevated societal stress, we collected data from a New York-based sample of trauma-exposed SMW between April 2020 and August 2020, a period of notable, compounding societal stressors, including: (a) living in or near one of the first epicenters of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in the United States and (b) living through multiple high-profile occurrences of racism-related police violence and subsequent racial unrest. SMW (n = 68) completed online self-report questionnaires related to trauma, PTSD symptoms, and alcohol use, and a subset (n = 29) completed semi-structured qualitative interviews. PsycINFO was searched with terms related to SMW, PTSD, and alcohol use to identify studies with samples of SMW from articles published within the last 10 years to which we could compare our sample; this produced nine studies. Welch’s t-tests and Chi-square analyses revealed that SMW within our sample reported significantly higher PTSD symptom severity, probable PTSD, and hazardous drinking indicators (i.e., alcohol use disorder and heavy episodic drinking) between April 2020 and August 2020 compared to similar samples (i.e., trauma-exposed SMW and general samples of SMW) assessed previously. Qualitative reports also indicated that the societal stressors of 2020 contributed to mental and behavioral health concerns. These results underscore the need for integrated PTSD and alcohol use prevention and intervention efforts for trauma-exposed SMW during times of heightened societal stress.

281,M9068,10.1037/tra0001517,Flexibility predicts chronic anxiety and depression during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic-A longitudinal investigation of mental health trajectories,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant stressor, potentially putting the well-being of the general population at risk. However, a significant proportion of the population exhibits resilience, raising questions regarding psychological constructs that could contribute to resilient coping. Studies indicate that flexibility, defined as the ability to adapt to changing contextual demands by employing various emotional, cognitive, and behavioral strategies, may significantly contribute to coping with long-term stressors such as COVID-19. METHOD: Cognitive and coping flexibility domains and longitudinal trajectories of anxiety and depression were assessed at three-time points across 13 months in 571 Israelis. RESULTS: Analyses revealed four different trajectories for anxiety: resilient (66%), chronic (22%), emerging (7%), and improving (6%), and two trajectories for depression: resilient (87%) and chronic (13%). Individuals in the chronic trajectory group (for both anxiety and depression) exhibited lower cognitive flexibility and coping flexibility levels than individuals in the resilient trajectory group. Across time, anxiety and depression were linked to clinically significant posttraumatic stress disorder-like symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Low cognitive and coping flexibility are linked to the probability of experiencing chronic mental health problems, making them a potential target for prevention and treatment.

282,M9109,10.1212/NXG.0000000000200053,Genetic Risk for Alzheimer Disease and Plasma Tau Are Associated With Accelerated Parietal Cortex Thickness Change in Middle-Aged Adults,"Background and Objectives Neuroimaging and biomarker studies in Alzheimer disease (AD) have shown well-characterized patterns of cortical thinning and altered biomarker concentrations of tau and β-amyloid (Aβ). However, earlier identification of AD has great potential to advance clinical care and determine candidates for drug trials. The extent to which AD risk markers relate to cortical thinning patterns in midlife is unknown. The first objective of this study was to examine cortical thickness change associated with genetic risk for AD among middle-aged military veterans. The second objective was to determine the relationship between plasma tau and Aβ and change in brain cortical thickness among veterans stratified by genetic risk for AD. Methods Participants consisted of post-9/11 veterans (N = 155) who were consecutively enrolled in the Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders prospective longitudinal cohort and were assessed for mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and posttraumatic disorder (PTSD). Genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for AD were calculated using summary results from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Disease Project. T-tau and Aβ40 and Aβ42 plasma assays were run using Simoa technology. Whole-brain MRI cortical thickness change estimates were obtained using the longitudinal stream of FreeSurfer. Follow-up moderation analyses examined the AD PRS × plasma interaction on change in cortical thickness in AD-vulnerable regions. Results Higher AD PRS, signifying greater genetic risk for AD, was associated with accelerated cortical thickness change in a right hemisphere inferior parietal cortex cluster that included the supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, and intraparietal sulcus. Higher tau, but not Aβ42/40 ratio, was associated with greater cortical thickness change among those with higher AD PRS. Mild TBI and PTSD were not associated with cortical thickness change. Discussion Plasma tau, particularly when combined with genetic stratification for AD risk, can be a useful indicator of brain change in midlife. Accelerated inferior parietal cortex changes in midlife may be an important factor to consider as a marker of AD-related brain alterations.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
283,M6058,,Sedation Vacation in the ICU,"As the name implies, the intensive care unit (ICU) is where a hospital’s sickest patients who require accelerated and concentrated care are admitted. Many of these patients, an estimated 33% of all admissions, are admitted for the respiratory failure of one etiology or another and subsequently are intubated and placed on mechanical ventilatory control. Part of the standard of care for intubation is to sedate the patient continuously to reduce pain and anxiety; decrease oxygen consumption and the body’s stress response; prevent patient-ventilator desynchrony; reduce adverse neurocognitive impacts such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and ventilator-associated events including pneumonia and tracheostomy, and reduce total nursing requirements. The medications used to initiate and maintain sedation within an intensive care unit setting include benzodiazepines such as diazepam, lorazepam, and midazolam; opioid analgesics such as fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine, remifentanil, propofol, dexmedetomidine, and ketamine; and antipsychotics such as haloperidol, quetiapine, and ziprasidone. No sedative is found to be superior in efficacy or mortality. However, The Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines states to avoid benzodiazepines due to evidence of a longer duration of intubation. The choice of which sedative is best lies in the practitioner’s clinical assessment of individual patient scenarios, weighing the risk/benefit profile of the medicine for each patient. Regardless of which sedative agent was utilized, total continuous sedation was found to be associated with an extension of the total length of intubation and increased length of the ICU stay and limited the ability to properly assess the mental status of the patient, increasing the risk for delirium, and suppressed brainwave function seen on EEG, linking to increased 6-month mortality. It was assessed that daily, short-term cessation of sedation, a “sedation vacation,” led to improved outcomes in patient care. Sedation vacations were first introduced in 2000 with a study by J.P. Kress et al. that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine and recognized as a medical necessity for standard practice within the ICU to wean patients from mechanical ventilation. The study of spontaneous-awakening trials showed that daily sedation interruptions improved the time to extubation of 64 patients by approximately 2 days which reduced the total admission time to the ICU by 3.5 days. This study was further reinforced by two separate trials, the Awakening and Breathing Controlled Trial in 2008 titled the “wake up and breathe” protocol and the No Sedation in Intensive Care Unit Patients trial in 2010. Both of these supporting trials investigated the impacts of imposing a protocol to evaluate and reduce sedation in a structured format and found that spontaneous-breathing trials along with sedation vacations reduced ventilatory dependent days and ICU admission days when compared to non-structured or no sedation vacation protocols.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
284,M9063,10.1037/tra0001426,Associations between International Trauma Questionnaire complex posttraumatic stress disorder symptom clusters and moral injury in a sample of U.K. treatment-seeking veterans: A network approach,"OBJECTIVE: Complex posttraumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) and moral injury are receiving increasing empirical attention. The network approach offers a novel method to understand the association between such mental health constructs. METHOD: The present study investigated: (a) the network structure of CPTSD symptom clusters according to the International Trauma Questionnaire to determine centrality (i.e., the most influential symptom cluster) and (b) the network structure of CPTSD symptom clusters and moral injury symptoms according to the Moral Injury Outcome Scale to determine bridge symptoms (i.e., the symptoms linking comorbid presentation of CPTSD and moral injury) within a clinical sample of veterans. RESULTS: Emotional dysregulation, avoidance, and interpersonal difficulties were found to be most central in the CPTSD network, and interpersonal difficulties, negative self-concept, and emotional dysregulation were found to be the strongest bridge symptoms in the CPTSD and moral injury network. CONCLUSIONS: The two networks suggest a key role of disturbance in self-organization symptoms in the presentation of CPTSD and its association with moral injury among treatment-seeking veterans. Despite the limitations of the present study, it offers an insightful starting point as the first network analysis study of CPTSD in treatment-seeking veterans as well as its association with moral injury.

METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used to survey 727 nurses at a teaching hospital in eastern Saudi Arabia. Three scales were used: the Quality of Life (ProQOL) scale, the Nursing Stress Scale (NSS), and the Job Satisfaction Survey (JSS). Data were analysed using SPSS and Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS), and SEM analysis was conducted to confirm the interrelations among variables. RESULTS: The final model had a good fit for the obtained data (X (2) = 2.726, RMSEA = 0.032). Stress is directly related to BO and STS, and the following variables were directly related to STS: job satisfaction, BO, and CS. Lastly, BO mediated the relationship between stress and STS. CONCLUSION: It is crucial to analyze the effect of stress, CS, and job satisfaction which seems to have a positive and negative impact on nurses' BO and STS.

286,M4987,10.1037/tra0001310,The Structured Trauma-Related Experiences and Symptoms Screener (STRESS): Assessing factor structure and clinical utility in a juvenile justice sample,"Objective: High prevalence of traumatic event exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among justice-involved adolescents has necessitated the use of trauma screening in juvenile justice settings. The present study explored the psychometric properties, factor structure, and construct validity of a trauma screen, the Structured Trauma-Related Experiences and Symptoms Screener (STRESS), in a detained adolescent sample. Prior to the current study, psychometric characteristics of the STRESS were evaluated only in a child welfare sample (Grasso et al., 2015). Method: The sample consisted of 132 adolescents in secure detention facilities in a southeastern state. Participants were included in the study if they engaged in the mental health screening process at intake and a follow-up assessment process with facility staff psychologists. Data consisted of de-identified, archival records. Results: The STRESS total symptom and 4 criterion symptom count scores demonstrated high internal consistency. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the STRESS had excellent fit with the DSM-5 four-factor PTSD model. Equally strong evidence was found for a higher order PTSD model, thus reinforcing the use of both STRESS PTSD total and criterion symptom count scores with justice-involved adolescents. Additionally, preliminary evidence of convergent and discriminant validity was supported. Conclusions: Findings support the STRESS as a reliable and valid trauma screen for use with detained adolescents. Results suggest that both STRESS total symptom and criterion symptom count scores have clinical utility for intake-level mental health decisions in juvenile detention settings. Implications for expanding use of the STRESS to inform appropriate interventions for justice-involved adolescents are discussed.

While many studies have focussed on refugees and asylum seekers, there is a considerable gap in the literature concerning undocumented migrants. AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the differences in mental health between documented and undocumented migrants in Belgium. It identified the post-migration difficulties encountered by these two groups and measured their impact on their levels of trauma, resilience, anxiety, depression and their assumptive world. METHOD: This study involved 69 participants, aged 18 to 68 years, who were either documented or undocumented resident in Belgium. Our data collection included the Post-Migration Living Difficulties Checklist for the measurement of post-migration difficulties, the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - DSM-V version for the measurement of trauma, the World Assumptions Questionnaire for the measurement of the assumptive world, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 for the measurement of depressive and anxiety disorders and the Adult Resilience Measure - Revised for the measurement of resilience. RESULTS: Our analyses showed that the mental health of undocumented migrants was poorer than that of documented migrants, with higher levels of trauma, anxiety and depression, a more negative assumptive world, a lower sense of control and lower total and personal resilience. Our results also revealed that post-migration living difficulties were more severe and more numerous for undocumented migrants, and that they were associated to different themes in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The fact that post-migration experience plays such an important role in the mental health of migrant populations raises significant clinical, political and societal considerations. Furthermore, it would appear that undocumented migrants represent a distinct migratory group with their own specificities in terms of migration journey and mental health.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cross-sectional data from men (n = 197) and women (n = 356) survivors of SV were analyzed with stratified (men; women) hierarchical logistic regressions. Additionally, fully adjusted models for the total sample included interaction terms to further assess whether associations between SV type as well as PTSD symptoms (sum, clusters) and physical activity differed significantly by sex. Sexual assault was negatively associated with physical activity in the crude model among women (ORs: 0.58; p < 0.05). Harassment was positively associated with physical activity in the crude and adjusted models (ORs:1.92–2.16; ps<0.05) among women. Among men, there were no significant relationships. Regarding PTSD symptoms among women, crude and adjusted stratified models identified significant positive relationships with intrusion (ORs: 1.18–1.22; ps<0.05). Crude and adjusted models revealed significant positive relationships between avoidance and activity (ORs:1.38–1.41; ps<0.05) among men but not women. The interaction term for this difference in the association between avoidance and physical activity by sex was significant (OR: 0.65; 95%CI: 0.48–0.88; p < 0.01).

This study sought to explore the manifestation of such difficulties during childhood, through first-hand accounts of those with DLD and their close relatives. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 mothers of children with DLD (aged 6-12 years old) and were analysed alongside the secondary data from interviews of five adults with DLD. Interviews were conducted online; all participants resided in Europe and were fluent in spoken and written English. A process of interpretive phenomenological analysis resulted in the development of five overall themes: experiencing anxiety, social frustrations, maintaining factors, childhood strengths and the parenting experience. Cognitive appraisals appeared particularly important during childhood in both escalating and maintaining anxiety, low self-esteem, emotion dysregulation and social frustrations. High levels of isolation and stress were experienced by all mothers. The findings suggest parents in the United Kingdom and Ireland require more support and guidance at the point of diagnosis than is currently provided. Emphasis was given to the link between children's experience of anxiety and social behaviours, such as withdrawal, as well as their intolerance of uncertainty. Internalising symptoms were a prioritisation for intervention during childhood by both parents and adults with DLD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Racial-identity profiles emerged from latent profile analyses and supported a three-class solution: undifferentiated, detached, and nationalist. Analysis of variance revealed that the nationalist profile group experienced significantly higher race-related stress compared with the detached and undifferentiated profiles. Moderation analyses revealed racial-identity profile type predicted both total posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and each PTSD symptom cluster; specifically, the nationalist profile type buffered the effects of race-related stress on PTSD symptoms. This study illustrates how stress from racial discrimination influences PTSD symptoms and the ways racial identity may mitigate this relationship, which has the capacity to inform the adaptation of PTSD treatments for minoritized groups. © The Author(s) 2023.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Impedance cardiography (ICG), especially when measured during stress, can help understand the underlying psychophysiological pathways linking PTSD with heart failure. We investigated the association between PTSD and ICG-based contractility metrics (pre-ejection period (PEP) and Heather index (HI)) using a controlled twin study design with a laboratory-based traumatic reminder stressor. PTSD status was assessed using structured clinical interviews. We acquired synchronized electrocardiograms and ICG data while playing personalized-trauma scripts. Using linear mixed-effects models, we examined twins as individuals and within PTSD-discordant pairs. We studied 137 male veterans (48 pairs, 41 unpaired singles) from Vietnam War Era with a mean (standard deviation) age of 68.5(2.5) years. HI during trauma stress was lower in the PTSD vs. non-PTSD individuals (7.2 vs. 9.3 ohm/s2], p = .003). PEP reactivity (trauma minus neutral) was also more negative in PTSD vs. non-PTSD individuals (-7.4 vs. -2.0 ms], p = .009). The HI and PEP associations with PTSD persisted for adjusted models during trauma and reactivity, respectively. For within-pair analysis of eight PTSD-discordant twin pairs (out of 48 pairs), PTSD was associated with lower HI in neutral, trauma, and reactivity, whereas no association was found between PTSD and PEP. PTSD was associated with reduced HI and PEP, especially with trauma recall stress. This combination of increased sympathetic activation and decreased cardiac contractility combined may be concerning for increased heart failure risk after recurrent trauma re-experiencing in PTSD.

292,M6900,,Mental health symptom correlates of child maltreatment and intimate partner violence classes: A latent class analysis,"Child maltreatment (CM) and intimate partner violence victimization (IPV) represent public health concerns that are rarely studied in combination, although research suggests that a history of CM increases the likelihood of IPV. Correlates of these victimization experiences often include depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and reduced self-compassion. Three hundred and twenty-seven females in college were surveyed to identify CM and IPV victimization classes and test associations between classes and the different correlates. Using latent class analysis (LCA), three distinct classes were identified: low, childhood, and lifetime victimization classes. PTSD symptom severity was positively associated with childhood victimization when compared to both low and lifetime victimization. Depressive symptom severity was associated with lifetime victimization compared to low victimization. Higher levels of self-compassion were associated with lifetime victimization compared to childhood victimization. Additionally, self-compassion buffered the relationship between depressive symptom severity and low (versus lifetime) victimization. These findings extend current research on CM and IPV. Clinical implications for trauma-informed treatment from these findings include comprehensive clinical interviewing to include both CM and IPV inquiry and a focus on preventative measures to decrease IPV in females in college with a history of CM. Lastly, females in college with low CM and IPV presenting with depressive symptomatology may be especially likely to benefit from self-compassion work.

293,M9020,,A neurocognitive approach to resiliency to stress and trauma,"An abundance of research investigates how cognitive deficits result from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, few studies test a competing perspective in which PTSD symptoms are related to pre-trauma cognitive ability. To date, research has revealed depression and anxiety as predictors of PTSD in college students. The goal of this study was to develop a cognitive profile reflecting who does or does not develop stress-related symptoms and probable PTSD following trauma, when accounting for depression and anxiety as established predictors. Specifically, this study sought to investigate the relationships between various domains of executive functioning and resiliency. It was predicted that a model including performance on tasks that tap set-shifting and non-verbal working memory would negatively predict perceived stress above and beyond a model including only measures of depression and anxiety. Furthermore, it was predicted that performance on a task of premorbid functioning (National Adult Reading Test NART]) would negatively predict perceived stress when administered alongside a measure of depression and anxiety. Eighteen participants from a diverse university and a local veteran's affairs office were recruited. Both depression and anxiety were found to significantly predict perceived stress scores. The addition of a task of verbal working memory (Digit Span Backwards) significantly improved the predictive power of the model that included only anxiety and depression. Furthermore, the addition of NART performance also improved the predictive power of the model. Overall, executive control and premorbid intelligence predicted perceived levels of stress beyond measures of anxiety and depression, supporting the notion that these skills can serve as protective/vulnerability factors in response to stress and trauma. These findings can inform screening procedures, treatment modalities, and prevention strategies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research also suggests that impaired self-control (in particular, heightened present bias) could be linked to delayed-onset post-Traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among survivors of natural disasters. We examined a hypothesis that the association between disaster experiences and delayed-onset PTSS is mediated through present bias among older survivors of the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami. Methods The baseline survey was conducted for older adults who lived in a city located 80 km west of the epicentre 7 months before the disaster. Approximately 2.5 and 8.5 years after the disaster, we surveyed older survivors to assess the trajectory of PTSS (2230 participants). We implemented analyses by three analytical groups: (1) resilient versus delayed-onset, (2) resilient versus improved and (3) resilient versus persistent. Results Logistic regression models showed that major housing damage was linked to raised present bias in all analytical groups (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.04 to 5.87; OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.20 to 6.29; OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.15 to 6.10, respectively). The present bias, however, was significantly associated with only delayed-onset PTSS (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.69). In the group of resilient versus delayed onset, housing destruction was also associated with delayed-onset PTSS (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.11 to 5.37), and the association was attenuated by present bias (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.07 to 5.18). Conclusions Present bias could mediate the association between housing damage and delayed-onset PTSS among older survivors of a natural disaster. © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

295,M9017,10.1017/S2040174423000181,The impact of adversities across the lifespan on psychological symptom profiles in late adulthood: a latent profile analysis,"People commonly face adverse circumstances throughout life, which increases risk for psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Adversities may occur during different periods in life. Especially adversity during early periods has been suggested to put individuals at risk for adverse mental health outcomes. Here, we investigated whether timing of adversity during the prenatal period, childhood, or mid-to-late adulthood differentially impacted classification into late adulthood symptom profiles. We performed sex-stratified Latent Profile Analysis to identify latent profiles regarding anxious, depressive, psychotic, and PTSD symptoms in n = 568 Dutch famine birth cohort members (n = 294 women, n = 274 men, mean age(SD) = 72.9(0.8)). Cross-sectional late adulthood symptomatology, childhood traumatic maltreatment, and adulthood trauma were based on self-report questionnaires. Prenatal adversity was considered present when individuals were prenatally exposed to the 1944-45 Dutch famine. In both men and women we identified one anxious/depressive profile and three profiles with approximately equal severity of all symptom types within each profile, yet differentiating in overall severity (low, mild, high) between profiles. We additionally found a PTSD symptom profile in women. In men, logistic regression models showed significant associations between prenatal, childhood and adulthood adversity, and profile classification, with differential effects depending on timing and most profound effects of child maltreatment. In women, childhood and adulthood adversity significantly increased classification probability into almost all profiles, with no significant effect of prenatal adversity. These findings support a time-dependent and sex-specific impact of adversity during different periods across the lifespan on psychological health, with consequences into late adulthood.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
296,M10790,10.1177/08897077231186677,"Dispensary Staff Perceptions About the Benefits, Risks, and Safety of Cannabis for Medical Purposes","BACKGROUND: Therapeutic use of cannabis is common in the United States (up to 18.7% of Americans aged ≥12), and dispensaries in the US are proliferating rapidly. However, the efficacy profile of medical cannabis is unclear, and customers often rely on dispensary staff for purchasing decisions. The objective was to describe cannabis dispensary staff perceptions of medical cannabis benefits and risks, as well as its safety in high-risk populations. METHODS: Online Survey study conducted using Qualtrics from February 13, 2020 to October 2, 2020 with a national sample of dispensary staff who reportedinteracting with customers in a cannabis dispensary selling tetrahydrocannabinol-containing products. Participants were queried about benefits (""helpfulness"") and risks (""worry"") about cannabis for a variety of medical conditions, and safety in older adults and pregnant women on a five-point Likert scale. These results were then collapsed into three categories including ""neutral"" (3/5). ""I don't know"" (uncertainty) was a response option for helpfulness and safety. RESULTS: Participants (n = 434) were from 29 states and included patient-facing dispensary staff (40%); managers (32%); pharmacists (13%); and physicians, nurse practitioners, or physician assistants (5%). Over 80% of participants perceived cannabis as helpful for post-traumatic stress disorder (88.7%), epilepsy (85.3%) and cancer (83.4%). Generally, participants were not concerned about potential cannabis risks, including increased use of illicit drugs (76.3%), decreases in intelligence (74.4%), disrupted sleep (71.7%), and new/worsening health problems from medical cannabis use (70.7%). Cannabis was considered safe in older adults by 81.3% of participants, though there was much less consensus on safety in pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis dispensary staff generally view medical cannabis as beneficial and low-risk. However, improvements in dispensary staff training, an increased role for certifying clinicians, and interventions to reduce dispensary staff concerns (e.g., cost, judgment) may improve evidence-based staff recommendations to patients seeking medical cannabis.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
297,M9014,10.1177/00207640231177829,The longitudinal impact of war exposure on psychopathology in Syrian and Iraqi refugee youth,"BACKGROUND: War and natural disasters lead to forced migration - and increased risk of adverse psychological outcomes - in approximately 1% of the global population. Though recent years have brought a greater understanding of the consequences of war exposure on mental health outcomes for refugee children, little is known about the longitudinal and developmental impact of these experiences on youth. AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of direct exposure to war and/or combat on trajectories of symptoms related to anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Syrian and Iraqi refugee youth following resettlement. Prevalence of possible anxiety disorders and PTSD was also assessed. METHOD: Participants included accompanied refugee youth resettled in the state of Michigan in the U.S. (n = 74). Youth filled out self-report measures of trauma exposure, anxiety symptoms, and PTSD symptoms upon arrival and 2 years later. Linear mixed-effects modeling was used to assess the effect of war exposure over time. RESULTS: Upon arrival, 38% screened positive for an anxiety disorder and 4.1% met diagnostic thresholds for PTSD. While war exposure did not predict changes to PTSD symptom trajectories (p = .481), anxiety symptoms increased over time among children reporting war exposure (B = 10.13, SE = 4.22, t = 2.40, p = .019). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that without appropriate interventions, anxiety- and trauma-related symptoms often do not decrease. Further, exposure to war trauma may lead to progressive worsening of symptoms. These findings suggest that assessing for type of trauma exposure, rather than focusing solely on migration status, may inform focused attention and interventions among trauma-exposed children resettling as refugees.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
298,M6057,10.1002/cbdv.202201038,Computational Design of Plant-Based Antistress Agents Targeting Nociceptin Receptor,"Stress is the body's reaction to the challenges it faces, and it produces a multitude of chemical molecules known as stressors as a result of these reactions. It's also a misalignment of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems causing changes in a variety of physiological reactions and perhaps leading to stress disorders. The reduction in neurotransmitter & neurohormonal hormones is mainly governed by the nociceptin receptor as G-protein coupled receptor and increased the level of reactive oxygen species. Various synthetic medicines that target nociceptin receptors were utilized to reduce the effects of stress but they come up with a variety of side effects. Because of the widespread utilization and renewed interest in medicinal herbal plants considered to be alternative antistress therapy. Our present work is an approach to decipher the molecular nature of novel herbal leads by targeting nociceptin receptor, under which herbal compounds were screened and validated through in-silico methods. Among screened leads, withanolide-B showed stable association in the active site of the nociceptin receptor as an antistress agent with no side effects. Furthermore, the selected lead was also evaluated for stability by molecular dynamic stimulation as well as for pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile. It has been concluded stable conformation of withanolide-B without presence of any major toxic effects. As a result, the in silico molecular docking technique is a highly successful method for selecting a prospective herbal lead molecule with respect to a specific target, and future research can pave the way for further exploration in the drug development field. © 2023 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Refugees experience elevated levels of adverse events and daily stressors, which are associated with common mental health difficulties such as depression. The current cluster randomised controlled trial aims to investigate whether an adapted form of Community-based Sociotherapy (aCBS) is effective and cost-effective in reducing depressive symptomatology experienced by Congolese refugees in Uganda and Rwanda.Methods: A two-arm, single-blind cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) will be conducted in Kyangwali settlement, Uganda and Gihembe camp, Rwanda. Sixty-four clusters will be recruited and randomly assigned to either aCBS or Enhanced Care As Usual (ECAU). aCBS, a 15-session group-based intervention, will be facilitated by two people drawn from the refugee communities. The primary outcome measure will be self-reported levels of depressive symptomatology (PHQ-9) at 18-weeks post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes will include levels of mental health difficulties, subjective wellbeing, post-displacement stress, perceived social support, social capital, quality of life, and PTSD symptoms at 18-week and 32-week post-randomisation. Cost effectiveness of aCBS will be measured in terms of health care costs (cost per Disability Adjusted Life Year, DALY) compared to ECAU. A process evaluation will be undertaken to investigate the implementation of aCBS.Conclusion: This cRCT will be the first investigating aCBS for mental health difficulties experienced by refugees and will contribute to knowledge about the use of psychosocial interventions for refugees at a time when levels of forced migration are at a record high.Trial registration: ISRCTN.org identifier: ISRCTN20474555.",2023.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
